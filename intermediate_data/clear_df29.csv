Both are anonymous functions and execute in the exact same way. But, the difference between the two is that in the second case scope of the variables is restricted to the anonymous function itself. There is no chance of accidentally adding variables to the global scope.
This implies that by using the second method, you are not cluttering up the global variables scope which is good as these global variable values can interfere with some other global variables that you may use in some other library or are being used in a third party library.

The top left entry stores the ""amplitude"" the ""base"" frequency and frequency increases both along the horizontal and vertical axes. The outcome of the DCT is usually a collection of amplitudes at the more usual lower frequencies (the top left quadrant) and less entries at the higher frequencies. As lassevk mentioned, it is usual to just zero out these higher frequencies as they typically constitute very minor parts of the source. However, this does result in loss of information. To complete the compression it is usual to use a lossless compression over the DCT'd source. This is where the compression comes in as all those runs of zeros get packed down to almost nothing.
One possible advantage of using the DCT to find similar regions is that you can do a first pass match on low frequency values (top-left corner). This reduces the number of values you need to match against. If you find matches of low frequency values, you can increase into comparing the higher frequencies.

You can however do this

The canonical example is
As it is much more common for people to want to do things with the result of a block, this is where it gets messy.
break/next mean different things in the context of a block.
break will jump out of the code that called the block
next will skip the rest of the code in the block, and 'return' what you specify to the caller of the block. This doesn't make any sense without examples.

If the first didn't break, I would go to the 4th floor and drop from there.  If that broke, I would go back down and get the other marble, then drop at the 3rd floor, breaking or not I would know which is the limit.
If neither broke, I would go get both, and do the same process, this time starting at the 6th floor.
This way, I can skip every other floor until I get a marble that breaks.
This would be optimized for if the marble breaks early...

Continuous integration seems to be a really good thing (or rather, the lack of it is really bad). That said, the organisations I've seen have usually been so small as to make any other approach seem foolish.
User story cards are nice in that it's great to have a physical object to throw around for prioritisation, but they're not nearly detailed enough unless your developer really knows the domain, or you've got an onsite customer (which I've never actually seen).
Standup meetings tend to be really useful for new team members to get to know everyone, and what they work on. The old hands very quickly slack off, and just say things like 'I'm still working on X', which they've been doing for the past week - It takes a strong leader to force them to delve into details.
Refactoring is now a really misused term, but when you've got sufficient unit tests, it's really useful to conceptually separate the activity of 'changing the design of the existing code without changing the functionality' from 'adding new functionality'",,,0,,2008-08-09 03:39:44.600000+00:00,,2008-08-09 03:39:44.600000+00:00,,,,,797.0,6579,2,7,,
6592,,"Objective-C uses Reference Counting, which means each Object has a reference count. When an object is created, it has a reference count of ""1"". Simply speaking, when an object is referred to (ie, stored somewhere), it gets ""retained"" which means its reference count is increased by one. When an object is no longer needed, it is ""released"" which means its reference count is decreased by one.
When an object's reference count is 0, the object is freed. This is basic reference counting.
For some languages, references are automatically increased and decreased, but objective-c is not one of those languages. Thus the programmer is responsible for retaining and releasing.
A typical way to write a method is:
The problem of needing to remember to release any acquired resources inside of code is both tedious and error-prone. Objective-C introduces another concept aimed at making this much easier: Autorelease Pools. Autorelease pools are special objects that are installed on each thread. They are a fairly simple class, if you look up NSAutoreleasePool.
When an object gets an ""autorelease"" message sent to it, the object will look for any autorelease pools sitting on the stack for this current thread. It will add the object to the list as an object to send a ""release"" message to at some point in the future, which is generally when the pool itself is released.
Taking the code above, you can rewrite it to be shorter and easier to read by saying:
Because the object is autoreleased, we no longer need to explicitly call ""release"" on it. This is because we know some autorelease pool will do it for us later.
Hopefully this helps. The Wikipedia article is pretty good about reference counting. More information about autorelease pools can be found here. Also note that if you are building for Mac OS X 10.5 and later, you can tell Xcode to build with garbage collection enabled, allowing you to completely ignore retain/release/autorelease.",,,1,,2008-08-09 03:48:10.417000+00:00,,2008-08-09 03:48:10.417000+00:00,,,,,457.0,6578,2,6,,

If you personally  an object, it comes with a reference count of 1. You are responsible for cleaning up after it when it's no longer needed, either by calling  or . release cleans it up right away, whereas autorelease adds the object to the autorelease pool, which will automatically release it at a later time. 
autorelease is primarily for when you have a method that needs to return the object in question (so you can't manually release it, else you'll be returning a nil object) but you don't want to hold on to it, either.
If you acquire an object where you did not call alloc/init to get it -- for example:
but you want to hang on to this object, you need to call [foo retain]. Otherwise, it's possible it will get  and you'll be holding on to a nil reference (as it would in the above  example). When you no longer need it, call .",,,0,,2008-08-09 04:25:46.537000+00:00,,2016-03-25 21:13:23.980000+00:00,2016-03-25 21:13:23.980000+00:00,Mike McMaster,5208764.0,,544.0,6578,2,4,,
6614,,"Let's start with  and ;  is really just a special case once you understand the basic concepts.  
In Cocoa, each object keeps track of how many times it is being referenced (specifically, the  base class implements this).  By calling  on an object, you are telling it that you want to up its reference count by one.  By calling , you tell the object you are letting go of it, and its reference count is decremented.  If, after calling , the reference count is now zero, then that object's memory is freed by the system.
The basic way this differs from  and  is that any given object doesn't need to worry about other parts of the system crashing because you've freed memory they were using.  Assuming everyone is playing along and retaining/releasing according to the rules, when one piece of code retains and then releases the object, any other piece of code also referencing the object will be unaffected.
What can sometimes be confusing is knowing the circumstances under which you should call  and .  My general rule of thumb is that if I want to hang on to an object for some length of time (if it's a member variable in a class, for instance), then I need to make sure the object's reference count knows about me.  As described above, an object's reference count is incremented by calling .  By convention, it is also incremented (set to 1, really) when the object is created with an ""init"" method.  In either of these cases, it is my responsibility to call  on the object when I'm done with it.  If I don't, there will be a memory leak.
Example of object creation:
Now for .  Autorelease is used as a convenient (and sometimes necessary) way to tell the system to free this object up after a little while.  From a plumbing perspective, when  is called, the current thread's  is alerted of the call.  The  now knows that once it gets an opportunity (after the current iteration of the event loop), it can call  on the object.  From our perspective as programmers, it takes care of calling  for us, so we don't have to (and in fact, we shouldn't).
What's important to note is that (again, by convention) all object creation class methods return an autoreleased object.  For example, in the following example, the variable ""s"" has a reference count of 1, but after the event loop completes, it will be destroyed.
If you want to hang onto that string, you'd need to call  explicitly, and then explicitly  it when you're done.
Consider the following (very contrived) bit of code, and you'll see a situation where  is required:

In well written code, that probably won't make a big difference to you, but it could certainly cause problems.

The long answer
Typically, one would not want to load files using absolute paths. For example, don’t do this if you can help it:
This technique is not recommended for at least two reasons. First, it creates a dependency on a particular operating system, which prevents the application from easily moving to another operating system. One of Java’s main benefits is the ability to run the same bytecode on many different platforms. Using an absolute path like this makes the code much less portable.
Second, depending on the relative location of the file, this technique might create an external dependency and limit the application’s mobility. If the file exists outside the application’s current directory, this creates an external dependency and one would have to be aware of the dependency in order to move the application to another machine (error prone).
Instead, use the  methods in the  class. This makes the application much more portable.

Once you start a double-quote string, PHP will go into interpolation mode and treat it as a string first, but looking for variable markers ($, {}, etc) to replace from the local scope.  This is why in most discussions, true 'static' strings should always be single quotes unless you need the escape-shortcuts like ""\n"" or ""\t"", because PHP will not need to try to interpolate the string at runtime and the full string can be compiled statically.

If dropping from the 3rd floor does not break the marble, drop from floor 6.  If it breaks, you know floor 4 or 5 is the highest.  Drop the second marble from floor 5.  If it doesn't break you've found that 5 is the highest.  If it does, floor 4 is the highest.  4 drops.

3 floors - maximum of 2 drops
6 floors - maximum of 4 drops
9 floors - maximum of 6 drops
12 floors - maximum of 8 drops

So for a 99 floor building you'd have a maximum of 66 drops.  And that is the maximum.  You'd likely have less drops than that.  Oh, and 66 is the maximum for a 100 story building too.  You'd only need 66 drops if the break floor was floor 98 or 97.  If the break floor was 100 you'd use 34 drops.

Get them to write lots of code, keep them asking questions to keep the brain juices flowing.
I would say dont get bogged down with the really detailed information until they either run in to the implications of them, or they ask.
I think one of the biggest points I would ensure is that they understand the core concepts of a framework. I know you are working in Python (which I have no clue about) but for example, with ASP.NET getting people to understand the page/code behind model can be a real challenge, but its critical that they understand it. As an example, I recently had a question on a forum about ""where do I put my data-access code, in the 'cs' file or the 'aspx' file"".
So I would say, for the most part, let them guide the way, just be there to support them where needed, and prompt more questions to maintain interest. Just ensure they have the fundamentals down, and dont let them run before they can walk.

6671,,"I've used both, but I have to agree with Justin Standard that you shouldn't really consider rewriting your existing tests to any new format.  Regardless of the decision, it is pretty trivial to run both.  TestNG strives to be much more configurable than JUnit, but in the end they both work equally well.
TestNG has a neat feature where you can mark tests as a particular group, and then easily run all tests of a specific group, or exclude tests of a particular group.  Thus you can mark tests that run slowly as in the ""slow"" group and then ignore them when you want quick results.  A suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as ""checkin"" tests which should be run whenever you check new files in.  I never saw such a feature in JUnit, but then again, if you don't have it, you don't REALLY miss it.
For all its claims of high configuration, I did run into a corner case the a couple weeks ago where I couldn't do what I wanted to do... I wish I could remember what it is, but I wanted to bring it up so you know that it's not perfect.

If you are looking for something ""different"", you can purchase icon sets for a couple hundred bucks. Considering the cost of having a designer create them for you, or doing them yourself, the cost of these sets is cheap!

6748,,"There is no hard and fast rule.  A problem is better solved with OOP when you are better at solving problems and thinking in an OO mentality.  Object Orientation is just another tool which has come along through trying to make computing a better tool for solving problems.  
However, it can allow for better code reuse, and can also lead to neater code.  But quite often these highly praised qualities are, in-relity, of little real value.  Applying OO techniques to an existing functional application could really cause a lot of problems.  The skill lies in learning many different techniques and applying the most appropriate to the problem at hand.
OO is often quoted as a Nirvana-like solution to the software development, however there are many times when it is not appropriate to be applied to the issue at hand.  It can, quite often, lead to over-engineering of a problem to reach the perfect solution, when often it is really not necessary.
In essence, OOP is not really Object Oriented Programming, but mapping Object Oriented Thinking to a programming language capable of supporting OO Techniques.  OO techniques can be supported by languages which are not inherently OO, and there are techniques you can use within functional languages to take advantage of the benefits.
As an example, I have been developing OO software for about 20 years now, so I tend to think in OO terms when solving problems, irrespective of the language I am writing in.  Currently I am implementing polymorphism using Perl 5.6, which does not natively support it.  I have chosen to do this as it will make maintenance and extension of the code a simple configuration task, rather than a development issue.
Not sure if this is clear.  There are people who are hard in the OO court, and there are people who are hard in the Functional court.  And then there are people who have tried both and try to take the best from each.  Neither is perfect, but both have some very good traits that you can utilise no matter what the language.

In order to decide what to do when you receive these headers, imagine that you are handling the GET request without these conditional headers.  Determine what the values of your ETag and Last-Modified headers would be in that response and use them to make the decision.  Hopefully you have built your system such that determining this is less costly than constructing the complete response.
If there is an INM and the value of that header is the same as the value you would place in the ETag, then respond with 304.
If there is an IMS and the date value in that header is later than the one you would place in the Last-Modified, then respond with 304.
Else, proceed as though the request did not contain those headers.

is not good that you raise every exception as an Exception object because you're losing (probably) valuable information
is not good neither to raise every kind of object that you catch because doing so you're failing in creating the facade

6916,,"@Brad Tutterow
The exception is not being lost in the first case, it is being passed in to the constructor.  I will agree with you on the rest though, the second approach is a very bad idea because of the loss of stack trace.  When I worked with .NET, I ran into many cases where other programmers did just that, and it frustrated me to no end when I needed to see the true cause of an exception, only to find it being rethrown from a huge try block where I now have no idea where the problem originated.
I also second Brad's comment that you shouldn't worry about the performance.  This kind of micro optimization is a HORRIBLE idea.  Unless you are talking about throwing an exception in every iteration of a for loop that is running for a long time, you will more than likely not run into performance issues by the way of your exception usage.
Always optimize performance when you have metrics that indicate you NEED to optimize performance, and then hit the spots that are proven to be the culprit.
It is much better to have readable code with easy debugging capabilities (IE not hiding the stack trace) rather than make something run a nanosecond faster.
A final note about wrapping exceptions into a custom exception... this can be a very useful construct, especially when dealing with UIs.  You can wrap every known and reasonable exceptional case into some base custom exception (or one that extends from said base exception), and then the UI can just catch this base exception.  When caught, the exception will need to provide means of displaying information to the user, say a ReadableMessage property, or something along those lines.  Thus, any time the UI misses an exception, it is because of a bug you need to fix, and anytime it catches an exception, it is a known error condition that can and should be handled properly by the UI.",,,0,,2008-08-09 21:17:35.057000+00:00,,2008-08-09 21:17:35.057000+00:00,,,,,122.0,6891,2,11,,

That will let you do as much of the processing in parallel, independently from the integration of the completed units of work back into the shared state.

6940,,"Personally, I have my windows set up so that one my main monitor, I have the main visual studio monitor, so therefore my code window, maximized, with only the toolbox docked, on the left. This means the code window takes up as much space as possible, while keeping the left hand edge of the code close to the middle of the screen, where my eyes naturally look. My main monitor is a wide screen, so I find that gives me more than enough room for my code.
My secondary monitor has a second window, which contains the tool windows that I use. So I have solution explorer, error list, task list (//todo: comments), output window, find results etc. all taking up as much space as they like on my secondary monitor.
When debugging, the solution explorer moves the main monitor, and the watch, autos and locals windows take its place.
I find this gives me a very large area to write code, and really helps usage of all of those additional windows, by giving them more real estate than they'd usually have.
Update: In response to everyone talking about using the second monitor for documentation or running the app, I wholeheartedly agree, and forgot to mention how I do that. I use PowerMenu alot to acheive this. Basically I can right-click on any window and set Always On Top. So while i'm debugging, i want to see my output window, but then if I have to refer to some documentation, I just flick to Mozilla (on the second monitor), set it on top, and go back to visual studio.

6943,,"Unfortunately, Matt's answer features what's called double-checked locking which isn't supported by the C/C++ memory model.  (It is supported by the Java 1.5 and later — and I think .NET — memory model.)  This means that between the time when the  check takes place and when the lock (mutex) is acquired,  may have already been assigned on another thread.  Thread switching happens whenever the OS wants it to, not between ""lines"" of a program (which have no meaning post-compilation in most languages).
Furthermore, as Matt acknowledges, he uses an  as a lock rather than an OS primitive.  Don't do that.  Proper locks require the use of memory barrier instructions, potentially cache-line flushes, and so on; use your operating system's primitives for locking.  This is especially important because the primitives used can change between the individual CPU lines that your operating system runs on; what works on a CPU Foo might not work on CPU Foo2.  Most operating systems either natively support POSIX threads (pthreads) or offer them as a wrapper for the OS threading package, so it's often best to illustrate examples using them.
If your operating system offers appropriate primitives, and if you absolutely need it for performance, instead of doing this type of locking/initialization you can use an atomic compare and swap operation to initialize a shared global variable.  Essentially, what you write will look like this:
This only works if it's safe to create multiple instances of your singleton (one per thread that happens to invoke GetSingleton() simultaneously), and then throw extras away.  The  function provided on Mac OS X — most operating systems provide a similar primitive — checks whether  is  and only actually sets it to  to it if it is.  This uses hardware support to really, literally only perform the swap once and tell whether it happened.
Another facility to leverage if your OS offers it that's in between these two extremes is .  This lets you set up a function that's run only once - basically by doing all of the locking/barrier/etc. trickery for you - no matter how many times it's invoked or on how many threads it's invoked.",,,0,,2008-08-09 23:09:01.400000+00:00,,2008-08-20 16:41:35.143000+00:00,2008-08-20 16:41:35.143000+00:00,Derek Park,872.0,,714.0,6915,2,14,,

6955,,"Basically, you're asking for synchronized creation of a singleton, without using any synchronization (previously-constructed variables).  In general, no, this is not possible.  You need something available for synchronization.
As for your other question, yes, static variables which can be statically initialized (i.e. no runtime code necessary) are guaranteed to be initialized before other code is executed.  This makes it possible to use a statically-initialized mutex to synchronize creation of the singleton.
From the 2003 revision of the C++ standard:
  Objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) shall be zero-initialized (8.5) before any other initialization takes place. Zero-initialization and initialization with a constant expression are collectively called static initialization; all other initialization is dynamic initialization. Objects of POD types (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions (5.19) shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place. Objects with static storage duration defined in namespace scope in the same translation unit and dynamically initialized shall be initialized in the order in which their definition appears in the translation unit.
If you know that you will be using this singleton during the initialization of other static objects, I think you'll find that synchronization is a non-issue.  To the best of my knowledge, all major compilers initialize static objects in a single thread, so thread-safety during static initialization.  You can declare your singleton pointer to be NULL, and then check to see if it's been initialized before you use it.
However, this assumes that you know that you'll use this singleton during static initialization.  This is also not guaranteed by the standard, so if you want to be completely safe, use a statically-initialized mutex.
Edit: Chris's suggestion to use an atomic compare-and-swap would certainly work.

In this case, so its easier for the calling class to make sense of all this, all these exceptions rethrow a single custom exception (FileOperationException) so that means the caller does not need references to System.IO or System.Xml, but can still access what error occurred through an enum and any important information.

7039,,"Development of shaders in XNA (which obviously uses DirectX) requires knowledge of HLSL or shader assembly. I'd recommend getting familiar with the former before diving into the latter.
Before writing any shaders, it's a good idea to get solid understanding of the shader pipeline, and attempt to get your mind around what is possible when using programmable shaders. When you're familiar with the life of a pixel (from source data all the way through to the screen) then understanding examples of shaders becomes a lot easier.
Next make an attempt to write your own HLSL which does what the Fixed T&amp;L pipeline used to do, just to get you hands dirty. This is the equivalent of a ""hello world"" program in vertex/pixel shader world. When you're able to do that and you understand what you've written you're ready to go onto the more fun stuff.
As a next step you might want to simulate basic sepcular lighting in one of your shaders from a single light source. You can then adapt this down the track to use multiple lights. Play with colours, and movement of lights. This will help get familiar with the use of shader constants as well.
When you have a couple of basic shaders together, you should attempt to make it so that your game/engine uses multiple/different shaders on different objects. Start adding some other bits like basic bump or normal maps.
When you get to this stage, the world is your oyster. You can start diving into some funky effectcs, and even consider using the GPU for more than it was originally intended.
For those who are a little more advanced, there are a couple of good books that are available for free online which have some great information from Nvidia here and here.

For setters, make sure to clone any mutable objects, and store the clone. This way, callers cannot change the passed-in object after the fact to break your program's invariants.
For getters, either return an immutable view of your internal data, if the interface allows it; or else return a clone of the internal data.
When calling user-supplied callbacks with internal data, send in an immutable view or clone, as appropriate, unless you intend the callback to alter the data, in which case you have to validate it after the fact.

From the C# language specification:
  The static constructor for a class executes at most once in a given application domain. The execution of a static constructor is triggered by the first of the following events to occur within an application domain:
  
  
  An instance of the class is created.
  Any of the static members of the class are referenced.

Also, it can be especially important in embedded projects to use types as a sort of ""safety net"" for things like unit conversions.  If you can use C++, I understand that there are some ""unit"" libraries out there that let you work in physical units that are defined by the C++ type system (via templates) that are compiled as operations on the underlying scalar types.  For example, these libraries won't let you add a  to a  because the units don't line up; you'll actually get a compiler error.
Even if you can't work in C++ or another language that lets you write code that way, you can at least use the C type system to help you catch errors like that by eye.  (That was actually the original intent of Simonyi's Hungarian notation.)  Just because the compiler won't yell at you for adding a  to a  doesn't mean you shouldn't use types like that.

7130,,"I'd recommend being defensive for data that enter a ""component"" or framework. Within a ""component"" or framework one should think that the data is ""correct"".
Thinking like this. It is up to the caller to supply correct parameters otherwise ALL functions and methods have to check every incomming parameter. But if the check is only done for the caller the check is only needed once. So, a parameter should be ""correct"" and thus can be passed through to lower levels.
Always check data from external sources, users etc
A ""component"" or framework should always check incomming calls.
If there is a bug and a wrong value is used in a call. What is really the right thing todo? One only have an indication that the ""data"" the program is working on is wrong and some like ASSERTS but others want to use advanced error reporting and possible error recovery. In any case the data is found to be faulty and in few cases it's good to continue working on it. (note it's good if servers don't die at least)

7151,,"The short answer is: No. In ASP.NET MVC Preview 3 there's no first-class way for including an anchor in an action link. Unlike Rails' url_for :anchor, UrlHelper.GenerateUrl (and ActionLink, RedirectToAction and so on which use it) don't have a magic property name that lets you encode an anchor.
As you point out, you could roll your own that does. This is probably the cleanest solution.
Hackily, you could just include an anchor in a route and specify the value in your parameters hash:
This will generate a URL like /Home/Index/#foo. Unfortunately this doesn't play well with URL parameters, which appear at the end of the URL. So this hack is only workable in really simple circumstances where all of your parameters appear as URL path components.",,,0,,2008-08-10 10:22:59.670000+00:00,,2009-05-19 03:55:19.133000+00:00,2009-05-19 03:55:19.133000+00:00,,878.0,,878.0,5628,2,1,,

7162,,"I am very much of the opinion that correct programming will protect against these risks. Things like avoiding deprecated functions, which (in the Microsoft C++ libraries at least) are commonly deprecated because of security vulnerabilities, and validating everything that crosses an external boundary.
Functions that are only called from your code should not require excessive parameter validation because you control the caller, that is, no external boundary is crossed. Functions called by other people's code should assume that the incoming parameters will be invalid and/or malicious at some point.
My approach to dealing with exposed functions is to simply crash out, with a helpful message if possible. If the caller can't get the parameters right then the problem is in their code and they should fix it, not you. (Obviously you have provided documentation for your function, since it is exposed.)
Code injection is only an issue if your application is able to elevate the current user. If a process can inject code into your application then it could easily write the code to memory and execute it anyway. Without being able to gain full access to the system code injection attacks are pointless. (This is why applications used by administrators should not be writeable by lesser users.)",,,0,,2008-08-10 11:27:30.960000+00:00,,2008-08-10 11:27:30.960000+00:00,,,,,891.0,6847,2,0,,
