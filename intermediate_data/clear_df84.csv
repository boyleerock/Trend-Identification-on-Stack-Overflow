creation of a ListEntry component derived from Container and overriding de.sae.tryout.modules.dragdrop.DraggableContainer.getComponentAt(int, int) to always return this to intercept all of the pointer interactions and
depending of its state passing through the pointer events to the child components if it is appropriate

41217921,AngularJS: data not passed into directive via attribute,"In my AngularJs (v1.5.9) app, I have a kind of list view directive that itself depends on a directive to render the individual, complex items. What exactly should be rendered inside the list items is decided by the consumer and passed in via transclusion.
So the basic structure looks something like this:
I am now trying to add another directive to this structure, that takes data that can be passed in via an attribute from the outside into the top-level element and then does stuff depending on that input for each of the list-items.
The structure is somewhat complex and I tried to reduce the code snippet below to the bare minimum. 
here is alsow a Codepen with the same example: https://codepen.io/lyioth/pen/LbqWLz/
Please note that the transclusion of the actual item content is not shown here (but that is working without a problem, so I skipped it).
The actual problem is that, the  in  stay undefined. I added some log statements to show that at the levels above this component the array in question is not in fact empty.
If I change the directive to also  the controller and access the  property directly, it seems to work. But I'd rather not do that.

41217836,How to encrypt Stripe keys in Wordpress database?,"My question is maybe not very limited to Stripe keys but maybe a general problem.
I developed a Stripe payment plugin for WP and gave the web site admin the ability to set her/his API keys (which are a public key and a secret key)  in an option page in the WP dashboard.
So far so good, I used php's  function to encrypt and save the keys in the options table.
Now here's the thing. When users go to website and buy something, how can I decrypt the keys, since I have no salt to compare against. 
I can create a salt to store in the database the first time the admin sets her/his keys in the admin dashboard but encrypting and decrypting the salt needs another salt.
So as far as I understand all encryption/decryption algorithms need a salt and it's logical. But in a scenario like this, what's the best way?
The following code is just for you to see what my code looks like even though it has not much to do with the problem I face.

eg. 10ms latency and 1000 tps mean there is an increase in tps (because 10ms latency mean 100tps) then there is a huge chance of the involvement of multi-threading or parallelism may be in the CPU level. If there is no optimization   while multiple transactions are batched.

It uses AVFoundation to extract CVPixelBuffer from a video file and then send that buffer to OpenGL as textures.

The AVFoundation provides each frame in YCbCr color space and it need to be transformed into RGB to render in OpenGL.

41217604,ngrx - update single item in a list of items,"I have somewhat the following Application State tree:
So, I have a list of items on a page. I load this list by dispatching an action to the MyList reducer. Once items are loaded, they are passed as an input to the MyListComponent, which accordingly creates MyItemComponents with the corresponding inputs.
MyItemComponent can be stand-alone as well. So, it's not always dependent on the MyList.
The thing is that each of the MyItems has its own actions (e.g. can be liked or edited). And I'm currently stuck where and what action should I dispatch in that case. How do I identify which item was updated and which list should I update.
What would be the action flow when user updates one of the items in a list?
And also - would the state change of MyList be detected if I change one of the MyItem directly?
Scenario I might think of is (while having all appropriate actions on MyItem itself) to add extra actions to the MyList - e.g.:
Then, somehow I fire another action from MyList to the specified MyItem from the array, item fires appropriate action to update its own state (updated via @Effect)
If an update was successful, a new action is fired to update the list.
To be honest, it all seems pretty verbose and vague. Not even sure how it would be implemented in practice. Really need suggestion from someone with experience.
p.s. 
I should mention that all the data is fetched and sent back from/to the REST api.

However, when I push the code to my ec2 instance (running the linux AMI), I get this crash:
I have checked that all the files and directories exist and are organized correctly in both cases.  The only thing I've deduced is that the ffmpeg versions vary between machines, so:

shared memory
For UDP:
The message to be sent is larger than the UDP message constrain (65535), so directly using  will get error: Message too long. And I also doubt whether it is a fast way (about 40~50Hz is ok).
For shared memory:
Shared memory seems to be a fast way to send image from c++ to c++. But since there is no pointer in python, I do not find a way to read and write data in shared memory.

Right now, how I have the code set up is that when the user submits the form, my code will submit the data first, and then upload the images.

So my solution to this is to upload the images first and submit the data after. The problem with this is that I'm not sure how I can tie the images to the data in a database record.
Should I upload all of the images to  and then move the files to a permanent directory, like  where  is the  of the database record? 
What should I do if the user uploads an image, but closes the tab half way. Then there will be an image in  that will stay there forever unless the directory is cleaned up. How would I clean it up?

41217283,How can Antennahouse Formatter handle referenced footnotes?,"I am developing a pdf print publication with xsl-fo (Saxon XSL 2.0, AHF V6.2).
My goal is to have auto-numbered footnotes (excluding duplicates on a single page) with inserted text from referenced static text elements.
So basically inline footnotes (fn) do reference a static footnote text element, create an inline number and print the according footnote text at the bottom of the page.
Duplicate inline footnotes in a chapter have to show the same number according to the footnote they are pointing to.
This is what the result should look like...
Is it possible to achieve these goals with the AHF footnote extensions and the fo:footnote elements?
The AntennaHouse Formatter extentions do deliver strange behaviour if I´m using them for fn counting. They do continue counting (1, 2, 3) instead of refereing to the correct and current number of the referenced footnote.

41217271,Chisel: how to implement a one-hot mux that is efficient?,"I have a table, where each row of the table contains state (registers).  There is logic that chooses one particular row.  Only one row receives the ""selected"" signal.  State from that chosen row is then accessed.  Either a portion of the state is connected as an output to the IO of the module, or else a portion of the IO is used as input to update the state.
If I were implementing this with a circuit, I would use pass-gates.  The selected signal would turn on one set of pass-gates, which would connect the row's registers to a bus.  The bus would then be wired to the IO bundle.  This is fast, small area, and low energy.
There is a straight forward way of implementing this in Chisel.  It encodes the selected row as a binary number, and then applies that number to the select input of a traditional mux.  Unfortunately, for a table with 20 to 50 rows, and state of hundreds of bits, this implementation can be quite slow, and wasteful in area and energy.
The question has two parts:
1) Is there a way to specify busses in Chisel, such that you have pass-gates or traditional tri-state drivers all hung off the bus?
2) Failing that, is there a fast, small area, low energy way of doing this in Chisel?

Caret Measuring Performance
But I get the error:
I would like to know 1) the general way to diagnose these errors that are the result of bad inputs into functions like this or 2) why my code is failing.
1)
So looking at the error It's something to do with 'X'.  Which argument is x? Obviously the first one in 'apply', but which argument in predict is eventually passed to apply?  Looking at traceback():
Now, this problem would be easy to solve if I could follow the code through and understand the problem as opposed to these general errors.  I can trace the code using this traceback to the code at C5.0.R#59.  (It looks like there's no way to get line numbers on every  trace?)  I can follow this code as far as this line 59 and then (I think) the predict function on line 44:

But after this I'm not sure where the logic flows.  I don't see 'makeDataFile' anywhere in the caret source or, if it's in another package, how it got there.  I've also tried Rstudio debugging, debug() and browser(). None provide the stacktrace I would expect from other languages.

41217202,Get incoming branch from push in a Git hook,"We are currently a team of 3 developers working in a project using gitlab.com
We have two servers, one for production and one for testing, both running on different droplets. 
After we're done with our changes, we push to the testing server where we have this Git post-receive hook (it's a bare repository):
We use a branch named 'testing' (which is checked out in the testing server), so everything works fine. After everything is OK, we merge that into master and then push to production. The issue here is that there might be sometimes where we need to create a branch to fix a bug in production but we don't want to upload the work in progress in our testing branch, and we also want to test out this hotfix branch in our testing server. 
That's why I figured we could just checkout the incoming branch in the testing server, so everyone can test their code on a live server without always having to have the testing branch checked out. Can this be done? I tried googling the git environment var for the incoming branch which would make it trivial from there but didn't get any luck. I know we all could just push and the manually checkout the branch in  the testing server but that solution is not appealing. It would be more efficient to do just with git push and let the server handle the rest!

41217052,What type of neural network to use?,"I've used this XOR example on Arduino to train a 2-input 1-output dataset. The Dataset I have contains around 30,000 values. I used 4 values instead of the XOR table and I got good results when tested.
I wanted to train it with more data. I couldn't do it on Arduino due to its RAM constraints. I've re-written the code in C and trained it in my laptop instead. I've given 20,000 values as the training dataset, it took around 2 days to train and I got very bad outputs. I've changed the hidden neurons to 4 and still the result is very bad. I mean I got the final error around 12. The way they calculated error in the given XOR example is by summing all the errors, so when I give 20,000 inputs, the sum is big enough.
Is there a better way I can do it? Should I increase the number of layers or hidden neurons? What is the best way I can fit a dataset with 30,000 values?

41217010,Eureka Forms for iOS - variable row height?,"All --
I’ve just started using Eureka forms builder on an iOS project, and it has a lot of wonderful features.  It’s very nicely done.
However, I eventually realized that there doesn’t seem to be a good way to customize the Height of any given row.  [Interestingly, in the Example app, many different rows demonstrating different features are all the same height.]
Granted I can override heightForRowAtIndexPath (which I’ve tried) ... but rows (and indexes) get added dynamically when they’re hidden and unhidden, which makes things more complicated.
Before getting into even more workarounds for this: Is there a simpler / more elegant way of adjusting individual row heights within the framework itself?
I’d like to set the height of any given row within the definition of each Row, or its ,  or similar closures.
Or even better, is there a straightforward way to have the UITableView respect the ‘intrinsic’ dimensions of only those labels which are used, according to the actual font sizes used?  In other words, if the font in a given row is smaller, that row height should be correspondingly less.  
Your help very much appreciated at this point.

I responded to the person that I agree and that it would be handled better at database or a gem that handles it via a database.  They disagreed and said you can make it efficient without using the database.  Can someone tell me how you can make this check work and be ""extremely"" efficient?
Basically, the function goes through every record and determines if a record with the same_value has more than 2 edits than the some_value of the current model.
So my argument is that you STILL have to pull every record in the database to compare the number of edits regardless of how you write this which makes it inefficient.

I understand the concept, but I can't totally see yet how the concept translates to code implementation. The following is a description of what I've got implemented, which is more-or-less guesswork.
I split the entire data set into K-folds, where 1 fold is the validation set, 1 fold is the testing set, and the data in the remaining folds are dumped into the training set.
Then, I loop K times, each time reassigning the validation and testing sets to other folds. Within each loop, I continuously train the network (update the weights) using only the training set until the error produced by the network meets some threshold. However, the error that is used to decide when to stop training is produced using the validation set, not the training set. After training is done, the error is once again produced, but this time using the testing set. This error from the testing set is recorded. Lastly, all the weights are re-initialized (using the same random number generator used to initialize them originally) or reset in some fashion to undo the learning that was done before moving on to the next set of validation, training, and testing sets.
Once all K loops finish, the errors recorded in each iteration of the K-loop are averaged.

The first rule (/users/&amp;user_id/chats) is OK and works as intended. I am able to query by user_id and get a map of all the chat_ids the user should have access to.
The second rule fails because what I thought I had was the chat_id but what I really have is the id for the object containing an attribute having the chat_id as uid, and I can't get to a child without knowing its ID, as rules are not filters.

41216832,Bring the Resource Server to refresh tokens?,"I have the following scenario in which the Resource Server is given an access token as well as a refresh token while requesting a resource (in my case a REST API).
The Authentication Server is a remote server, so I have implemented the Resource Server by using RemoteTokenServices and @EnableResourceServer.
The scenario works like this: the user goes to a login form and provides its username and password. The Client validates the credentails with the Auth Server and when successful it saves a cookie in the user browser with the access and refresh token.
Now the User goes to another subdomain (technically accessing another application) and is expected to be recognized. 
The Client and the Resource Server do not have any communication links. 
I am aware that it is not best practice to have the refresh token leave the client. 
Now my question: since I already have the refresh token, I would like to extend the functionality of my application by allowing the RS to refresh tokens as well. I know that according to the OAuth2 specification, this is not the role of the RS. Does it mean I need to implement the Client? If yes, how do I do that?

41216759,Techniques for detecting small blobs in noisy images,"I am trying to write a program that uses computer vision techniques to detect (and track) tiny blobs in a stream of very noisy images. The image stream comes from an dual X ray imaging setup, which outputs left and right views (different sizes because of collimating differently). My data is of two types: one set of images are not so noisy, which I am just using to try different techniques with, and the other set are noisier, and this is where the detection needs to work at the end. The image stream is at 60 Hz. This is an example of a raw image from the X ray imager:
Here are some cropped out samples of the regions of interest. The blobs that need to be detected are the small black spots near the center of the image.
     
Initially I started off with a simple contour/blob detection techniques in OpenCV, which were not very helpful. Eventually I moved on to techniques such as ""opening"" the image using morphological operators, and subsequently performing a Laplacian of Gaussian blob detection to detect areas of interest. This gave me better results for the low-noise versions of the images, but fails when it comes to the high-noise ones: gives me too many false positives. Here is a result from a low-noise image (please note input image was inverted). 
The code for my current LoG based approach in MATLAB goes as below:

My requirement is to find the matching asset numbers, concatenate them and insert into a new table based on logic. The logic here is see if there are matching asset numbers based on the key. If there are no matching assets but the key is the same, then concatenate all the assets.
This is how the source table looks like
 
This is how the target table should look like
 
In order to achieve this, I wrote the following code first. But it is not concatenating all the records that matches the key. Could you help me modify the code?

But while running Orchid, both https and http are not working.
One more thing is that, when i try to connect to some website from java class (using HttpURLConnection class) where the method for starting tor service is invoked, I am able to access both http and https websites (Tor service is working since I am getting a new ip address each time I visit whatismyip.com)
The reason i am not going with java based web scraping libraries like jsoup is that the websites i am trying to scrape data from use javascript excessively. Due to this, i always  end up getting an imcomplete page which is not the case with phantomJs. And also i don't want to continue using tor.exe for running the tor service as it makes the project heavy. And also i cannot control tor.exe completely from java

I am able to receive message notifications when the app is killed, in background and in foreground.

I am thinking of accessing the sharedprefs in my FirebaseMessagingService to see if the app should show the notification and check what ringtone to use. Unless there is a generic way to set those parameters, like ""unsubscribing"" from all notification or changing the app default notification ringtone which I am not aware of?  
However I have no idea how i can do it for the notifications received when the app in is the background since the notifications are delivered to the device's system tray.

41216576,Tensorflow: transfer learning from vgg16 .tfmodel file,"I'm trying to make a TF implementation of an image classifier (with py3.5 and Windows 10, TF 0.12), so I'm re-using existing models as described here but without all the weird Bazel stuff. After fixing a py2-to-3 bug on this line (wrapping the  in ), it ran nicely on my 10 folders of different categories. However, the performance is lacking; the training success rate is around 83% and the validation set is never above 60% at best. So I'd like to do some transfer learning from a vgg16 model (which is one I've used before in Caffe/ubuntu); one I've found is here ready to be downloaded. 
My question now is, how do you load a .tfmodel file in Tensorflow? The script is expecting a tar.gz to be downloaded, fair enough. It apparently contains a file called , which is not a .tfmodel file. Looking in some example code I see that it's pretty easy to load a .tfmodel file, so I've modified the  function to point straight at the  file. Upon running this, I get this error:
And this is the loading code:

41216519,Is there an alternative algorithm to do the following task in Python(Astronomy pipeline),"First a bit of background.This is a problem that we are facing while making the software pipeline of a newly launched spacecraft.
The telescopes on board are looking at a specific target. However as you might expect the the telescope is not exactly stable an wobbles slightly. Hence at different time instants it is looking at SLIGHTLY different portions of the sky.
To fix for this we have a lab made template (basically a 2-d array of zeros and ones) that tells us which portion of the sky is being looked at a specific time instant(lets say t). It looks like this. 
Here the white portion signifies the part of the telescope that is actually observing. This array is actually 2400x2400(for accuracy. Cant be reduced because it will cause loss of information. Also it is not an array of 0s and 1s, but instead real numbers because of other effects). Now knowing the wobbles of the telescope, we also know that this template will wobble by the same amount. Hence we need to shift(using np.roll) the array in either by x or y direction(sometimes even rotate if the spacecraft is rotating) accordingly and accumulate(so that we know which portion of the sky has been observed for how long. However this process is EXTREMELY time consuming and lengthy(even with numpy implementation of add and roll). Moreover we need to do this in the pipeline at least 500 times a second. Is there a way to avoid it ? We are looking for an algorithmic solution maybe a fundamentally new way of approaching the whole problem. Any help is welcome. Also if any part is unclear let me know. I will happily explain it further.

41216509,CheckBox If Statement checking is not not checking the nest condition,"Functionality:
Users are to input their details in a form that consists of: dropdown menu, input textfield and a checkbox. Hence, the first check is to ensure that the appropriate fields are filled and no blank fields, and if all appropriate fields are filled, the second condition will check if the checkbox has been ticked. Depending on whether the checkbox has been ticked, it will perform the third check. If the checkbox is checked(user only has to spend 50 dollars to proceed else an error msg will appear) else if checkbox is not checked(users to only spend 100 dollars else an error msg will appear).
Hence the functional flow as follows:
if (dropdown menu_1 &amp; input text field_1 is filled OR dropdown menu_2 &amp; input text field_2 is filled ), it will check on checkbox -> if (checkbox is ticked), it will check on the value -> if (input text field_1 is more than $x OR input text field_2 is more than $x  OR input text field_1 + input text field_2 is more than $x)
Issue:
Irregardless of the value the user has input in the textfield, the condition check for the value to be either more than 50 dollars or 100 dollars is is always called. 
Hence, even if user were to check the box and input 20dollars, the correct behaviour is to show error msg that the user has to spend 50 dollars but the current behaviour allows the user to submit the details and proceed to the next page.
I would need some assistance on what has been wrong as the check syntax is to check for the value in the  textfield is it is more than the stated values depending on the state of the checkbox.

Second issue is, I need the equivalent sightly code for JSP to include a resource in the component. I am not sure whether the code which I have written using the data-sly-resource is correct or not.
Below is the error log I am getting when I am trying to run the above java/htl code:

I'm comparing my answers to the result of the SVD function and my middle matrix is perfect but some of the signs on my left and right matrices are flipped. Also if I try and display the image again using my SVD it looks like a low rank approximation of the original picture.
Basically what I'm doing is using eig() to take the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of AAtranspose and AtransposeA and then reordering them from largest to smallest. As far as I understand eig() puts them in order from smallest to largest so I just used the fliplr function to swap the order.
I'm not terribly experienced with Matlab so I might be making a silly mistake.

It has a lot of data for the past 2 years, and I really feel at this point I don't need so much in there.

I understand because it's ISAM there is a lock that will occur where no writing can take place? I would probably delete data by the month, and do it late at night, to minimize this as it's a production DB.
My prime interest, specifically, is this: should I take some sort of action after this deletion? Do I need to manually tell MYSQL to do anything to my table, or is MYSQL going to do all the housekeeping itself, reclaiming everything, reindexing, and ultimately optimizing my table after the 400,000k records I'll be deleting.

41215852,how to sort non-english strings?,"I did look up answers, and they are good for the standard alphabet. but I have a different situation than that.
so, I am programming in Java. I am writing a certain program. this program has at some place some list of string items.
I would like to sort those string items according to the alphabet.
if I would sort it by English alphabet, it would be easy since usually all code pages are compatible with American standard code for information interchange (ASCII), and they have all letters of English alphabet already sorted, so, if I would like to sort my list, I would only have to compare the values of chars to determine which letter goes where.
but my problem is, that I do not want to sort a list by using the English alphabet.
my program has the option to display in English or some other languages.
the problem is that some of those languages have different alphabet from the English alphabet, therefore letters are not the same as those in the English alphabet, and thus simple &lt;, and > validation of char values does not work because letters are not sorted correctly in the code page.
for the purposes of this question lets say English alphabet is as follows:
let's say there is a certain country named ""ABC"" whose alphabet goes like this:
first of all, if a is equal to 97 on code page, b 98, c 99 et cetera, how can I sort my list using the second alphabet in this example, since the second alphabet has its first letter equal to 100, second equal to 98, third to 103 et cetera?
and my second question:
unfortunately, some of the countries I am translating my program too has alphabet where some combinations of letters are treated as one letter.
for my second example, let's say that country ""def"" has the following alphabet:
here:
d - the first letter in the alphabet,
g - second letter in the alphabet,
be - third letter in the alphabet (ONE letter, although it is written as two letters, it is considered to be just one letter, and has its position in the alphabet),
e - fourth letter in the alphabet,
the - fifth letter in the alphabet (also written as two letters, but treated as ONE letter),
c - sixth letter in the alphabet,
f - seventh letter in the alphabet.
as you can see in this imaginary example number 2 of imaginary country ""def"", this country has really screwed up the alphabet.
and after presenting these two examples of these two alphabets of two imaginary countries, you understand why I cannot use the standard method for sorting strings.
so, can you please help me out with this sorting. I am not sure what I can do to sort according to this screwed up alphabet.
post scriptum:
lines below this are not important for the question, but they are just more info if anyone wants to know where I have found such screwed up alphabet
well, i gave those examples which consists of 7 randomly ordered letters just for the purpose of this question - to make it more simple. in case you wonder, what my real problem is - i am trying to translate my program to croatian. croatian alphabet is really screwed up because it goes as follows:
as you can see, Croatian alphabet is somewhat similar to the English alphabet, but most of the letters are not at the same location as English ones, and several of them do not exist in English alphabet at all, and several letters are one letter which is written as two letters. so really difficult to sort. so I hope someone knows some method of doing it.
of course, there is the dumbest method for sorting which will always work and can sort anything, and that is method with switch statement, where I compare two string items, and for each letter i use switch statement where switch statement has 31+default=32 cases from which, each of them has its own switch with 32 cases. what is in total 1024 cases, and if my average case has 4 lines of code, I end up that if I want to sort strings using the non-English alphabet, that my sort method would be at least 4096 lines long.
and that is a huge method.
this is the dumbest way of sorting, but only one I can figure out at the moment.
so I am asking here because I hope someone would know any simpler method to do this. the method which is not so big as 4k lines of code just to sort stupid strings.
I have a method for sorting English strings and it takes up only a bit more than 10 lines of code.
I hope someone can suggest me something less than 4k lines of code.
so if anyone knows the simpler solution, I would appreciate it.

41215737,Swift 3 (SpriteKit): SKShapeNode not moving when its image is changed,"I have come across an issue with SKShapeNodes that I'm struggling to understand. To help explain and show my problem, I have created a test program. At the start I create a line like this:
At this point, I am able to change the position of the node, and it prints the position I expect it to be:
It prints:
  LINEPOS = (0.0, -50.0)
This makes sense because the SKShapeNode's original position is always (0, 0). However, the next part of the program doesn't work in the same way. I make the new points equal the coordinates of where the Line is now on the screen, and let the Line equal them like this:
Then I change the position of the Line again (this time I moved it down by 200 so the change in position is more noticeable) like this:
It prints:
  LINEPOS = (0.0, -200.0)
Even though it prints the position correctly, it is clear that the Line hasn't moved at all on the screen. It is still at the same position as it was when I let the line equal the new points. This means that after letting the SKShapeNode equal a new set of points, it no longer moves on the screen but in the code it says it does.

41215565,Delphi - How to bind Items of an Enumerator-Type to a ComboBox and Bind Selected Item to An Object,"I have created a few custom Enumerator-Sets.
Example:
Now I want to fill a Combobox with all the Items defined in my Set.
So my fist thought was to use the TypeInfo, GetEnumName and GetEnumValue-Functions.
(I tried binding a TStringList to the ComboBox with a seperate Adapter but that didn't work).
After filling my ComboBox I went on to use LiveBindings to bind the property 
""SelectedValue"" to the TStatus-property of my Object, which is simply called Status.
there are three problems though.
The Combobox shows no Value when I scroll through my Objects even though I assigned a default value to the Status-property.
the Amount of Items in the combobox is:
So if I have 2 Objects I have 6 Items in my Combobox when it should remain at 4
If I select a Value from the combobox and want to Post it to my Object it doesnt access my Setter-Function.
This whole Live Bindings stuff is still new to me but I'd like to learn it properly.
So if you could help me solve these issues, it would be appreciated.
Thank you for your time.

41215546,Is there a principal that requires this type of consistency in query results?,"I was testing a service response, (same service same operation different parameters).
When searched by birth date one of the returned results was let's say client id = ""CID1234"".

When I raised the issue I was told that client search by Id only returns active clients and that is consistent with observed results.
Somehow I think there must be an equivalent to conservation of energy, there should be conservation of data/information. A record within a same service-operation can not both exist and not exist at the same time depending on the query parameter, as if it was a SQL query for sure it wouldn't make sense, it would break some rule that I can not think what it might be called.

41215541,Dataflow jobs fail after a few 410 errors (while writing to GCS),"I found a similar SO question from August which is more or less what my team is experiencing with our dataflow pipelines recently. 
How to recover from Cloud Dataflow job failed on com.google.api.client.googleapis.json.GoogleJsonResponseException: 410 Gone
Here is the exception (a few 410 exceptions were thrown over a span of ~1 hour, but I am pasting only the last one)
Here is the job id: 2016-12-18_17_45_23-2873252511714037422
I am re-running the same job with the number of shards specified (to be 4000 as this job runs daily and normally outputs ~4k files), based on the answer to the other SO question I mentioned earlier.
Is there a reason why limiting the number of shards to a number below 10k helps? Knowing this can be useful for us to re-design our pipeline if needed. 
Also, when the number of shards is specified, the job is taking much longer than it would without it specified (mainly because of the step that writes to GCS) -- in terms of $'s, this job usually costs $75-80 (and we run this job daily), whereas it cost $130-$140 (that is a 74% increase) when I specified the number of shards (other steps seem to have run for the same duration, more or less -- the job id is 2016-12-18_19_30_32-7274262445792076535). So we really want to avoid having to specify the number of shards, if possible. 
Any help and suggestions will be really appreciated!

The output of this job seems to be disappearing and then appearing in GCS when I try 'gsutil ls' at the output directory, even 10+ hours after the job is completed.

41215536,Rails/Ruby... 50mb string performance,"I'm trying to send 1mm rows worth of data to the browser.
Unfortunately this is a situation where I can't use pagination.
The actual raw PG query takes only 3 seconds. I'm interacting with  directly so there's no rails overhead making rails instances... only a raw array.
I originally was calling  on the result set from  but found that calling  is like 100x faster (and because its a simple array I don't need anything fancier).
The problem is that now the  method is taking 10 seconds where the SQL query only takes like 1-2.
Is there a better way I can send this much data in a response with a quick conversion to a string?
The other option I'm going to look into is using a job to push this data to S3, and then stream the raw data file to the browser from S3, but it still doesn't change the fact I'm going to have to convert it to a string before sending to S3, and I assume that will just be extremely slow.

There is also a spring filter that handles the authentication using tokens. Everything works pretty well but there is a small problem. Each dao object is creating its own session factory on construction like so.
This is a problem because if you create multiple dao objects, you quickly run out of connections and even though I call session.close() after each dao call. After making too many calls to the resources, my tiny db instance is complaining about too many connections. My immediate thoughts were that the session factory needed to be managed by jersey. So I attempted to a factory binder like so:
In the resource config:
And changing BaseDAO to this
It doesn't seem to work - session factory is always null. The other problem is that the spring filter can't use the jersey inject. The filter is configured like this.
Whether I use @Autowired or @Inject in BaseDao, sessionFactory is always null. I cannot switch over to purely spring. Is there any way to get this sessionFactory working? Is this the best way to handle the session factory in a rest service or is there a better way to not open a new session on each request?

I'd like to space these out ~100ms apart to prevent this. I tried using setInterval like to accomplish this, but it seems that the geocodeAddress line is run for all entries at once, so this would only delay all of the functions, not the length between each.

41215255,How can a free tagging field be created in a Microsoft access form?,"Setup
Access 2007
This is a simplified scenario. It is nearly identical to my actual use case just easier to explain. I have a many to many relationship between movies and genres the table structure is below.
Table: movies
id autonumber
name text
Table: genres
id autonumber
name text
Table: movie_genres
movie_id number
genre_id number
I would like a form that allows me to list all genre's for a given movie. But also allows me to create new genre's without opening a separate form. Similar to the way free tagging works in a cms website like Drupal or Wordpress.
My Attempt 1
I have successfully created a form that allows me to display all tags using a sub-form pointing to the movie_genres table and a combo box pointing to the genre table. This form setup also allows me to select existing values as new genres. It does not however allow me to create new genre's. 
In this form if I type a value not present I get the warning ""The text you entered isn't an item in the list.""
If I attempt to change the combo box to ""Limit To List: No"" I get the warning: ""The first visible column... isn't equal to the bound column."" If I make the first visible column the bound column the combo box simply displays numbers and not names, which is silly because the information is there either way.
The form for this simplified case looks like:
My attempt 2
I can also create a subform that points to both the movie_genres and genres tables with a regular textbox pointing to genre name. This allows me to create new values but it does not let me select from existing values. No pic of this one.

I have two VMs set up. One is named KDC-TESTING. It's a Domain Controller with Active Directory installed and a user named ""testuser"". It's running on the KDC.COM domain.
The second is running an IIS server named IIS-WEB that runs on the KDC.COM domain.
I also have my computer (windows 7). It's on a different domain, but it's currently using the domain controller's IP as its DNS. I'm trying to run the Basic GSSAPI client from eclipse on here.
When you go to iis-web.kdc.com (from either the domain controller vm or my computer), you're prompted for a username/password combo. You can log in using testuser (with its password, obviously).
When I run the client program, I get the following error:
It's thrown from this line:
Since it says the credentials are invalid, I added in the following (and tried creating the context with  rather than ):
That changed literally nothing (except for the stack trace).
Looking at this question and a bunch of docs/blogs, I think the problem is somewhat related to configuration, but I'm not sure what configuration needs to be done exactly.
I've got a krb5.conf file set up, and I'm running it with the command line arguments shown here.
I haven't done any Kerberos setup on my computer, but I've an SPN to testuser and maybe set up a keytab on the VMs (but I'm almost certain that that's not the cause).
EDIT/UPDATE:
I ran it from a new VM that was both on the KDC.COM domain and used KDC-TESTING.KDC.COM as its DNS and it seemed to work as expected (there was another error, this time with authenticating - progress! I think I know what's wrong with this one though).
I ran it as a JAR (as opposed to from inside eclipse) and, as expected, I was prompted in the command window for a username and password. Could this have been an issue (as in, is eclipse not able to take input, so it just crashes or something)?

The way it is currently implemented as above in , it starts to fade into the next color when the page is half-way scrolled between the next page, and with a 1 second animation, it will become that color within 1 second, regardless of if the next page is half-way or fully shown.

1- I tried the following code:
and the resutl was
  1111111100000000
As if its a two byte variable.
2-Tried converting all numbers in the range to binary:
If I omit the  the loop goes on. and with the break, the code in the loop does not execute, some how as if -128 is greater than 127.
My Conclusion:
As I thought that -128 must not fit in a unsigned byte variable and the first and second tries approves that (111111110000000 > 01111111)

41215081,How do I copy class instance to my subclass in python,"I have looked at some similar answers but none that seem to address the particular problem I am trying to solve.
Background: I'm using pyqt and QT Designer to design my layout. Currently using pyuic to turn the layout in to a .py file.

I would like to extend the QListView class and then copy this particular instance to my new class.
i.e. In my ui.py file I have:
In my mainfile.py i have put a placeholder but image a more methods
And ideally i would like to take the existing taskList and copy all attributes.
i.e.
note the above obviously won't due to 'arg', However I have tried similar methods that don't seem to copy all the instance attributes, by using various forms of copy in the init and passing the instance to MyNewClass i.e.:
Other options that were successful but just looked weird included using types module and monkey patching like below:
which prints:
  my object name taskList is dancing
however since I will have a few additional functions and 3 or 4 additional variables this seemed messy.
So what is my best way to achieve this without manually modifying my pyuic generated file each time? I also may want to use many of these methods in another QListView instance that I have.
Edit: There is a way to do this as marked by @ekhumoro using qt designer, which I guess would work in my very particular case (which is awesome to know and didn't even think about that!).

41215048,Swift 3 Parallel for/map Loop,"There's quite a few threads on this however Using Grand Central Dispatch in Swift to parallelize and speed up “for&quot; loops? uses Swift &lt;3.0 code and I can't get the equivalent to work in 3 (see code). Process Array in parallel using GCD uses pointers and it gets a bit ugly so I'm going to assert right here that I'm looking for the nice Swift 3 way to do it (as efficiently as possible of course). I also heard groups are slow (?) maybe someone can confirm that. I couldn't get groups to work either.
Here is my implementation of a striding parallel map function (in an extension of Array). It want's to execute on the global queue so as to not block the UI. It may be that the concurrent bit doesn't need to be in the scope, only the remainder loop.
Error 1: our old friend  on the inner array assignment line about half the times I test it. I'm guessing this suggests a simultaneous access issue.
Error 2:  never executes!
Error 3: errors go on forever, I'm sure this will happen once the above are fixed.

The parser accepted it as a  and not as .
Than i tried to place the character rule on top of my scanner, and from the same reason as before - all the following rules with characters in the printable range could not be matched.
My question is what can i do to create a rule that will match all printable characters but also rules for specific characters.

41214915,Avoiding making classes generic by using unchecked type casts,"Let's say I create a package  with a public class , which has a constructor that expects a parameter of type . The class  lies in a different package beyond my control and contains objects of arbitrary type . The container with the contained items is passed around between multiple classes of the package .
The items are processed via methods of the interface . They can be retrieved by the user of  via the method . This method returns a processed item with the property  which is ensured to be contained by the passed container and can therefore be cast to the type parameter of the container.
example class:
Is it generally a good idea to make an unchecked type cast in a situation like this?
The only reasonable alternative I figured out so far is to make all classes in the package  that have to hold a reference to the parameterized container (like ) also generic just for the sake of preserving the type information needed in .
EDIT:
To clarify the functionality of the container class in my example:
I wanted the container class to represent some rather primitive collection-like class which should merely make it possible for the processor to retrieve the items it has to process.
That means  and classes used by  should be able to handle the processable items (once they are retrieved from the container)
as they like (e.g. store them in lists or other data structures). And finally it should be possible to request a processed item based on a certain processor-specific property. For example:
Like java's standard collection classes (e.g. )  does not strictly guarantee that it only contains  and its descendants. This means once an item of the container is used as a , while actually not being a , a cast exception occurs. 
In the version of the Processor class above no exception is immediately thrown when an item requested via  is not compatible to type  (due to the unchecked cast). But also if I made  generic () and made its  return I instead of using the unchecked cast, no exception would be thrown at that point. Therefore I am also unsure if it would be better to make a runtime type check using a  object in . The  object would have to be explicitly served by the caller as a parameter or via the given container. I feel like it should not be the processor's concern to ensure that the items in the container are actually compatible with , because the processor is not responsible for the validness of the content of the given container.

so my guess is that postgres did the conversion of encoding for me. but I am not sure. I thought I have to set the client encoding as UTF-8 to make it work?
EDIT:
is this the correct link? postgres doc. thanks",,0,2,,2016-12-19 02:03:46.683000+00:00,,2016-12-19 02:10:38.257000+00:00,2016-12-19 02:10:38.257000+00:00,,2379736.0,,2379736.0,,1,0,python|postgresql|encoding|utf-8,432
41214874,Ionic 2 Missing source to debug on ios device,"I am an experienced Ionic 1.xx developer but am struggling with my first attempt at debugging an Ionic 2 ios app on the device.  Android is no problem, can chrome://inspect and build with --debug option and get full access to .ts source files for setting break points from chrome.  However, when building for ios ( ionic build ios --debug ) it webpacks everything and no .ts files are available from Safari Web Inspector when running on the device.
My config files (tsconfig, package.json ) are obviously working right because the build works fine ( sourcemaps enabled, etc ) for android.
What am I doing wrong?  ",,1,0,,2016-12-19 02:03:39.050000+00:00,,2016-12-20 15:47:55.113000+00:00,,,,,2930111.0,,1,3,ionic2|source-maps|safari-web-inspector,398

However, when I call , it does not seem to call . I feel so because when I put a line   within the method body of , it does not seem to stop at that point.

41214871,Point Kernel for Jupyter Notebook at Matlab,"I am trying to get Jupyter Notebook to work with Matlab. I found a very helpful blog post about this which got me as far as being able to create a MATLAB notebook. The blog post proposes the following steps:
Download and install Anaconda.
Install the Python packages  and .
Define the path to the MATLAB executable by typing the following in a terminal:
Restart terminal. Then using MATLAB from a Jupyter Notebook should work.
My issue is with the third step, which is to point the kernel to the MATLAB executable. It is written for someone using a Mac, and I am on Windows 10. I'm not familiar enough with what is being done here to ""translate"" this step for Windows. Here are the instructions for a Mac:
I would deeply appreciate any suggestions on how to accomplish this step in Windows 10.",41215053.0,1,0,,2016-12-19 02:02:50.253000+00:00,,2016-12-19 02:39:05.567000+00:00,2016-12-19 02:39:05.567000+00:00,,4221706.0,,7314586.0,,1,1,matlab|jupyter-notebook,406
