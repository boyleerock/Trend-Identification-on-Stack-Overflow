12803898,Unexpected behavior of the JPL library in multithreaded programs (Interfacing Java and Prolog),"I have been experimenting with the multithreading features of JPL. As far as I understand from the comments in the source code one different Prolog engine is assigned per Java thread.
Apparently there is a problem when a query is started in thread A, another query is executed in thread B (spawned by thread A), and a third query is executed again in thread A.
The following snippet of code illustrates the problem:
Since the JPL documentation mentions that no two queries can be active at the same time, the code waits until completion of the thread before continuing to the last query (it is not yet clear to me if that constraint applies only to queries in the same thread or if it applies to queries in different threads and engines).
In the previous example, only the first two queries succeed. When the third query is executed I obtain this fatal error:
Is this a bug in JPL ? in that case does someone know a workaround for using JPL with multithreading ?
I have tested with both YAP version 6.2.2 and 6.3.2 with the same results.
UPDATE:
As @sharky suggested, apparently it is a problem with the YAP binaries (or the JPL port for YAP). When using SWI the example showed in the question is working fine.
Still I am puzzled with the JPL behavior in multi-threaded programs.
Taken a look to the source code and comments of the  method in the  class from the JPL library:
it seems to say that JPL will create a new logic engine per thread.
However, if I execute this simple program:
I can see the following output:
So apparently the second thread is accessing the same Prolog engine than the first one, not a new one as the source code and its comments seems to suggest.

I thought that after getting the register part working then this would be the easy part but I can't see how to do this.
In my user controller for Index do I need to pass in a viewModel? Or do I just set up the viewModel within the Index method and then pass to the view? I tried setting up the view model in here without success, thinking it would be similar to the set up in the accounts controller but I get errors no matter what I try.

My App consists of several viewcontrollers, which get pushed onto a navigationcontroller. All viewcontrollers are supposed to be in landscape orientation, except for one, which should be in portrait orientation. In iOS 5 everything worked fine, but now the one controller in portrait mode is also shown in landscape mode and of course gets distorted.
My iOS 5 code looked like that:
Viewcontroller in landscape mode: 
Viewcontroller in portrait mode: 
Now that I found out about the changes in iOS 6 I implemented 
AppDelegate: (allowing all orientations, like in the plist)
Viewcontroller in landscape mode: (restricting orientations to landscape mode)
Viewcontroller in portrait mode: (restricting orientations to portrait mode)
From my understanding this should work, but the truth is it works even less than before.
First, the landscape mode viewcontrollers don't stay in landscape mode, they rotate freely in all directions, this is of course not what I wanted. Second, the viewcontroller in portrait mode will crash with 
After some trial and error I only seem able to lock all controllers to landscape mode, via the plist file/appdelegate, which of course forces the portrait mode controller also into landscape mode. On the other hand I can manage to have the portrait mode controller in proper orientation, but this will also rotate the landscape mode controllers into portrait mode. I can't seem to get both to work.

However, the website is mostly informational, the only authentication will be for site admins (workers at the organization) to login and upload videos or other media. Also, there on one section of the site, users need to be able to post comments on a comment board (which should be stored in a database). Other than that, the site is mostly static and informational, relying mostly on design and content to attract users to the organization.

12803749,ASPDotNetStoreFront: Unable to cast transparent proxy to type on AddIn,"I'm having a very odd issue with an old ASPDotNetStoreFront project that we recently redesigned for a client. The redesign went great, but our only AddOn to the project, an in-house created plugin for tax calculation, now will not work. No changes were made to the plugin and I can confirm that it was working up until the redesign. All of our changes to the site were cosmetic in nature. ASPDotNetStoreFront uses an ERP Provider for AddOns as detailed in this PDF I'm familiar with the provider only through this project and have little experience with it elsewhere, which may explain some of my issues with it.
The weird part is that ASPDotNetStoreFront is recognizing that the AddOn exists and fails when attempting to invoke the contract for it. (In this case, it's using ITaxRates and is trying to invoke ITaxRatesContract.) This happens every time I try to activate it and I get
the following error:
It will find the add on, add it as a token in the core's AppLogic class, sets a variable in ITaxRatesViewToContractAddInAdapter to the Tax Add On and then cause the error above.
Some things of note that happened with this project:
This was pulled from our SVN server onto a new laptop, so this is the first time this project has been built on this computer. I don't know if that actually should make a difference, but at this point, I'm willing to go with anything.
I've attempted to clean the project, as well as the pipeline the AddIns use to the same results. No luck.

I've got an AppsScript application running as user1 published as a Web App. In it I've implemented doGet().
I've got another Appscript application running as user2. I try to do a URLFetch on the published URL and get back a bunch of HTML indicating that the requestor needs to logon.
If I do the same URL fetch from the browser as 'user2', the doGet() is accessed perfectly and returns what I need.  
It seems you can't make get (or post - I tried both) HTTP requests between Appscript applications. N.B. Both users are on the same domain and as stated above, it works when user initiated from the browser. It's like the user's identity isn't being passed from App to App.
This is a test case as I'm trying to work out the best way of moving data from one application to another. Google has the ContentService for returning data but I want to push data. Push is best for the architecture I'm considering as there will be several apps (10+) trying to push to the one app at any one time, so scaling is important. The ContentService lends itself to a polling approach which won't scale if the one app, polls the other 10. Will get timeouts etc.  Any tips re: such an architecture appreciated.  The other option I've got is for the 10 apps to write directly to the ScriptDB attached to the main app. I don't like this option because the only way to share a ScriptDB is at the project level and every app will be able to see everything in the ScriptDB and there will be no isolation of data at the app level. I realise I'm pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Appscript and fully expect that as an answer, but with the new offerings in AppScript, Enterprise level customers are considering these approaches for lightweight apps.

12803606,Managing/processing several separate forms,"I have an interesting problem that I've been trying to simplify. I have a telecommunications client who has several sign-up forms - each representing a different program/offer. Each form is essentially the same, but some have form fields that others do not. As you can imagine, this is a nightmare both in the database and in the CRUD code. 
Right now as it stands, each form is processed individually and goes into a dedicated MySQL table for each application form. So horrifically, each application has a separate CRUD code. I wish to defer to the experienced as to how to best handle this situation. 
I thought about parsing the form elements into CSV. I'd define a schema of sorts that identifies the elements so the CRUD can easily work off one table. However this is an issue because sometimes these form elements change which can make it difficult to keep everything organized and clean. I also though about having a base form with standard elements, then forms that are requiring different elements would be stored elsewhere with some FK.
I'm really at a loss as to what I could do to make this easier. I hate having several tables for applications, and several CRUDs for processing...
TLDR; How can I best manage processing/storing several unique/rather large (20 so elements) forms in a database and implement CRUD on them.
Thanks for your time.
EDIT I also just thought about implementing JSON or XML which would define the form elements and accepted data types. This could be modified by the system, and upon saving, could generate a cached HTML form page and updated SQL code for each application. That way, I can solve the editing problem.

When I execute the code in most browsers (just paste it into your browser's JavaScript console), the parsed-then-serialized XML is equivalent to the original. For example on Chrome 8 I get:
However on Chrome 22 the same code fragment changes the XML to:
Note that the namespace prefix  used by the title and href attributes is not defined anywhere, so the XML is now invalid. As you probably can imagine this causes all kinds of problems for code that tries to subsequently use the XML.
Is this a bug in the XMLSerializer or am I missing some intricacies about how the DOM should be serialized? 
Also did anyone find a workaround that I can put in code, as opposed to make the XML match the apparent preference to use  as the prefix for the XLink namespace?
Update
I did some additional testing and the problem seems to be caused by the fact that the XMLSerializer recognizes the XLink namespace and insists on outputting an  prefix for it, without properly registering that prefix.
So this fragment work fine:
So here I changed the Namespace URL to something less well-known and the output is now valid:

12803449,Best practices for creating a data log,"I am creating a program that will run a bunch of motors. These motors interface to a motor controller, that my program talks to as well. I can tell the motor controller to periodically give me data about its state, as well as the state and position of each motor. I plan to have a live view of this data, so the operator can easily see if something is wrong, and additionally create a log of this data, so someone can go back afterwards and see what went wrong, and possibly why.
Here comes the question: What should I consider when creating this log? I am fresh out of college and have never really encountered a situation such as this. Of course I know how to create a file, put data into it, and close the file, but is there more to a data log?
Things I have already considered are:
It'd be good to have time stamps to each data record.
it may be ideal to be verbose with the data, rather than keep it binary. Longer setup time, better end result.
I must be careful to close the file up, regardless of how the program is ended.
I am using C++/CLI, I wonder if MSFT has some framework to make this straight forward...

12803433,SQL query mixing aggregated results and single values,"I have a table with transactions. Each transaction has a transaction ID, and accounting period (AP), and a posting value (PV), as well as other fields. Some of the IDs are duplicated, usually because the transaction was done in error. To give an example, part of the table might look like:
In this case the transaction was added in AP2 then removed in AP5.
Another example would be:
In the first example, the problem is that if I am analyzing what was spent in AP2, there is a transaction in there which actually shouldn't be taken into account because it was taken out again in AP5. In the second example, the second two transactions shouldn't be taken into account because they cancel each other out. 
I want to label as many transactions as possible which shouldn't be taken into account as erroneous. To identify these transactions, I want to find the ones with duplicate IDs whose PVs sum to zero (like ID 123 above) or transactions where the PV of the earliest one is equal to sum(PV), as in the second example. This second condition is what is causing me grief.

The bit in chevrons is what I'm trying to do and I'm stuck. Can I do it like this or is there some other method I can use in SQL to do this?
Edit 1: Btw I forgot to say that I'm using SQL Compact 3.5, in case it matters.
Edit 2: I think the code snippet above is a bit misleading. I still want to mark out transactions with duplicate IDs where sum(PV) = 0, as in the first example. But where the PV of the earliest transaction = sum(PV), as in the second example, what I actually want is to keep the earliest transaction and mark out all the others with the same ID. Sorry if that caused confusion.
Edit 3: I've been playing with Clodoaldo's solution and have made some progress, but still can't get quite what I want. I'm trying to get the transactions I know for certain to be erroneous. Suppose the following transactions are also in the table:
In this example sum(PV) &lt;> 0 and the earliest PV &lt;> sum(PV) so I don't want to mark any of these out.
If I modify Clodoaldo's query as follows:
This gives the result

12803426,"Loading modules, security and product keys","I'm working on a modular application in .NET using Unity and Prism V4. An advantage to having a modular design is the ability to easily add and remove features. It is a requirement that I am able to create versions of the application that add or exclude certain features. Using Prism and Unity, I can do this by loading the assemblies (.dll files) for the required features. I like this because it allows me to cleanly and precisely exclude an entire feature.
I have certain features which absolutely must not be included in some versions of the application for our own liability. I want to prevent a user from being able to copy another user's .DLL file into his directory to gain that functionality. Other people with similar concerns may be interested in selling ""plugin modules"" as upgrades to an additional product and limiting access to those who have purchased the add-on. This isn't quite what we are doing, but is also not to be completely ruled out.
Now, with Prism and Unity there are multiple ways to register the module catalog, including in code, from a directory, from an application configuration XML file, or you can write your own. One of the simplest methods is for the application's shell to reference each assembly and the code specifically loads the assembly files for that configuration. This does make it slightly more difficult to simply copy a file from someone else and get that feature. However, I'm afraid it could lead to the possibility of configuration mistakes, or prevent the more general purpose ""add-on"" scenario (i.e. you would need to recompile the application shell to include features).
If I hard code the assemblies to load, I'll probably have to #ifdef on a build environment variable to determine which modules should be loaded. This doesn't really prevent someone from copying the files over if they grab the shell executable and the additional libraries. It also seems more difficult to keep track of the specific build to go into different installer projects and prevents the purchased add-on scenario. To me, it seems best if the application's shell didn't need to reference the modules directly.  Maybe, it could load the assemblies from a specific location but could somehow verify with a product key or elsewhere, that the user is supposed to have access to that module.
I'm interested if anyone has experience or insight on how to license modules or restrict access to modules to different users (versions) of the application. The basic application may be entirely free and require no license. Probably nothing can be foolproof, but I need to do my best to make it not easy for someone to get around the system. Another requirement is that I do not believe I can require my users will have internet access (in case there were some sort of licensing method which would require this). Of course, I'm not sure this is not limited to the discussion of .NET, Prism or Unity, but that is what I'm using for this project. 
Signing each assembly with a strong key name can help me verify the modules are from a trusted source, but I'm not sure that would be helpful in the licensing. Maybe there is a product key system that can be used which would indicate which modules were allowed? Anyway, I'll stop there because I'm open-minded about any approach which solves this problem and I don't want to focus discussion along one specific idea or path.

Thus, in iOS 6, you need to be very careful to never move your finger while pressing a button on the UI. (Or, perhaps they just changed the definition of ""small"" in small-drag.)
We believe that disabling multi-touch gestures in the Settings > General page improves things somewhat, although we're not convinced this isn't a placebo effect.
As a test, I tried removing the scroll-preventing:
from our code, but it made no difference (other than making it really obvious that the drag events are dragging).
My next idea is to go through and change everywhere that we rely on onclick to instead rely on ontouchstart, but, well, yuck. (Particularly, yuck, in cases where we also need the same code to work in desktop browsers.)

12803309,Android WebView Asset Reference Memory Leak,"My Android 4.0.4 application consists of a WebView through which the user can view multiple pages stored locally in the asset directory.  When cycling through the pages, the following error eventually gets triggered and the application crashes:
JNI ERROR (app bug): local reference table overflow (max=512)
Failed adding to JNI local ref table (has 512 entries)
VM aborting
Fatal signal 11 (SIGSEGV) at 0xdeadd00dd (code=1)
The problem seems to be related to the ones reported here:

Android WebView Memory Leak when using Assets
Viewpager Webview memory issue
I've used the Memory Analyzer Tool plugin instructions given at the following link to examine the details:
http://therockncoder.blogspot.ca/2012/09/fixing-android-memory-leak.html
Results are shown below (can't post screen captures yet, so text will have to do):
MAT Excerpt
Log Excerpt
By looking at the MAT entries, it appears that the main Thread is holding references to all HTML pages, CSS and Javascript files, images and audio files and does not release them.  Eventually when a new URL is called, the AssetManager tries to write entries beyond the bounds (512 entries) of the JNI local ref table, exhausts the available space and causes a memory leak.
I've tried all sorts of things to try to prevent retaining the references, with no luck.  This includes:
initializing the WebView so that it does not cache the pages:
trying to remove all existing WebView data before loading the next page:
creating the WebView dynamically rather than through the res/layout XML, and assigning it the application Context rather than the Activity context:
destroying the current WebView before changing pages and dynamically creating a new one for the next page, but this has no effect other than slowing down the application; the JNI local table still retains the old references:
The ideal thing would be to remove the old entries in the JNI table prior to loading the next page, but I've found no way to do that -- once a URL is called, the asset directory references are held despite what I've tried.  Maybe I've missed something or a fix is pending in a later release of Android?  Failing that, even though destroying and creating new WebViews for each page negatively affects performance and it would complicate the design, if the pages could be created within their own Thread and hold their own asset references rather than the main Thread, maybe that would work (provided those Threads can be stopped during a page change).
Update
I tried creating my WebViews in separate threads and got the error ""All WebView methods must be called on the UI thread. Future versions of WebView may not support use on other threads."".  I'm assuming 'UI thread' refers to the main thread.  This posting seems to support that:

We allow the users to import their own themes (so their own CSS content) and for that reason we do not pre-compile our assets in production (I am aware of performance reasons of pre-compiling, however we don't find the performance hit that bad, and this was the best decision for us).
Since we want to support multiple languages, we also have translation files. Rails translations being in  and then we have translations required for our Javascript files. Previously we were putting these translations in a  file - but this is highly unscalable for the future. We wanted a solution that would allow the Javascript files to pull from the  files. We came across the  Gem ( i18n-js ).
This gem works exactly as expected locally. However, in production, we are getting errors. The first problem was  could not locate the  file. To me, this made sense, since we were not pre-compiling the assets, and the i18n-js Gem would obviously not be installed on the production server, the application would not have access to the i18n.js file. So I added the file manually in the  path. That fixed that error.
Now we are getting this error:
I have checked the  and the  and the file is actually there... So that confuses me. My thoughts are that the i18n-js Gem simple assumes that you are pre-compiling your assets and was not designed to function without that in production where the gems are not actually installed on the server. However, I was wondering if anyone could provide some guidance on that thought? Am I right, or is there a way around this?
Note: If I do pre-compile the assets - there are no issues in production. And also note, this production issue has only shown up when we started using this Gem - so I know it is related to that gem's usage, and nothing else. Everything was working before this change.
Also, if anyone has better suggestions for getting around the language problem (we don't want translations maintained in a JS file, AND in a locales YAML file). I would appreciate suggestions to that end as well!

While it runs well on Websphere, we are in desperate need to use a 64 bit JVM given the complexity of our product and how it pertains to the necessary use of the system.  We are trying to avoid buying a license for Websphere, as it will cost a good sum of money.  
I have tried to install this application on practically every Java Application Server I can find and Glassfish seems to be the most promising.  The issue it seems to have is how it processed the libraries it wants to use.

I did use some arbitrary class inside it.  I then created a simple jsp to test the version of that same class when the application is deployed.  It came out to 2.2.6.  I know that Glassfish has a jaxb jar file of a newer version, so it is clearly using this one. 
How can I force my application to use the classes in its own lib folder over the ones being used by the app server?  I feel that this is the only thing holding back Glassfish from being my replacement app server.

12803234,How to map code points to unicode characters depending on the font used?,"The client prints labels and has been using a set of symbolic (?) fonts to do this. The application uses a single byte database (Oracle with Latin-1). The old application I am replacing was not Unicode aware. It somehow did OK. The replacement application I am writing is supposed to handle the old data.
The symbols picked from the charmap application often map to particular Unicode characters, but sometimes they don't. What looks like the Moon using the LAB3 font, for example, is in fact U+2014 (EM DASH). When users paste this character into a Swing text field, the character has the code point 8212. It was ""moved"" into the Private Use Area (by Windows? Java?). When saving this character to the database, Oracle decides that it cannot be safely encoded and replaces it with the dreaded ¿. Thus, I started shifting the characters by 8000: -= 8000 when saving, += 8000 when displaying the field. Unfortunately I discovered that other characters were not shifted by the same amount. In one particular font, for example, ž has the code point 382, so I shifted it by +/-256 to ""fix"" it.
By now I'm dreading the discovery of more strange offsets and I wonder: Can I get at this mapping using Java? Perhaps the TTF font has a list of the 255 glyphs it encodes and what Unicode characters those correspond to and I can do it ""right""?

The load_and_authorize_resource behaviour
With rails, controller and model names are linked up by convention. The attribute  takes that to its advantage. When an action is hit that requires an instance of a resource, the  verifies whether the instance of the resource can be accessed. If it can, it will load it up in an instance variable, if it cant, it will return a 404 or any error behaviour you have configured the attribute to produce.
For example, if I have a resource picture, and only user that own a certain picture can edit the picture's name. 
So we would have a Edit action, which obviously would have a pictureId of the picture you want to edit.  load_and_authorize_resource would verify whether the current context/user has access to the resource.

If I run XJC without passing the  parameter, generation works fine, and classes are generated under the  package:
All I want to do is change the package name of the generated classes to something more project appropriate, e.g. :
However, doing this breaks JAXB generation spectacularly, throwing collision errors on almost every element.  I can work around this by generating the classes via the first method, and then refactoring them to the  package, but that's not very maintainable and doesn't port well to the maven-jaxb2-plugin.  
Can someone explain why this is happening, and if there is a way to work around it with XJC?  I feel like if JAXB works via the first method, it should work via the second, since all that needs to be done is a simple String substitution for the package name.

It is expected that in Live environment, there will be highly transient connection to the internet at deployed locations. 
I have set Retry Policy and time-out in BlobRequestOptions as below:
The above statements are in a background task that work as expected and I have appropriate exception handling in background task and the continuation task.
In order to test exception handling and my recovery code, I am simulating internet disconnection by pulling out the network cable. I have hooked up a method to System.Net.NetworkChange.NetworkAvailabilityChanged event on UI thread and I can detect connection/disconnection as expected and update UI accordingly.
My problem is: If I pull the network cable while a file is being downloaded (via blob.DownloadToFile), the background thread just hangs. It does not timeout, does not crash, does not throw exception, nothing!!! As I write, I have been waiting ~30 mins and no response/processing has happened in relation to background task.
If I pull the network cable, before download starts, execution is as expected. i.e. I can see retries happening, exceptions raised and passed ahead and so on.
Has anyone experienced similar behaviour? Any tips/suggestions to overcome this behaviour/problem?
By the way, I am aware that I can cancel the download task on detection of network connectivity loss, but I do not want to do this as network connectivity can get restored within the time-out duration and the download process can continue from where it was interrupted. I have tested this auto resumption and works nicely.

12803064,Android Expandable List View - onClickListener for buttons within the child with persistent states,"I am currently having an issue with the creation of my ExpandableListView. I'm unsure what is happening at the moment but I'll explain what I'm trying to do.
I programmatically allocate meals that fall on a certain day. Within each meal (the title is the group) is a child that contains a vote and order button. Both of which are changed to ""Ordered"" when a order is made on a meal. If another order is made the previous order button goes back to the 'order' state and the selected one goes to ordered. This is the same for vote. I go about this by setting an on click listener to my buttons that loop through all the other buttons and set their text to 'order'/'vote' and set the current buttons text to ordered.
This works fine in some extremely rare cases - but most of the time when I order/vote for an item it changes the selected one to 'ordered' and the last element in my expandable list view to ordered as well. Then if I order, lets say the 3rd element, close and reopen the second element it also changes to ordered and visa versa. Sometimes they all change back to order or all change to ordered. I'm finding it difficult to work out why this may be happening.
I believe it may have something to do with the getChildView function. As when I traverse through the list opening each element the view is never set for the last element even though it has been allocated the appropriate data.
Am I misunderstanding a major concept of the ExpandableListView or is there something else.
Here is the getChildView function that I believe there may be a fault. I'll also supply links to the other relevant classes below. If you need further information, please don't hesitate to ask.

I could of course destroy the buffer at the end of the phase where it is used, however I don't know in advance if the vector contents and/or length are modified and if they aren't I would rather keep the old buffer, since afaik that would enable it to stay cached on the device, reducing the amout of data needed to be transferred over the pci-e bus.

12802842,Manually creating a Split View layout without using UISplitViewController,"I'm diving into iOS development and I'm trying to create an iPad app that uses the split view layout, without using the UISplitViewController. I found this question already posted, but it's too vague to help me with my current level of iOS experience. 
In short, I have a UIViewController class named MySplitViewController that contains two children view controllers, one for the master view and one for the detail view.  I'm trying to implement this in a way that when I push an instance of MySplitViewController onto the nav stack, I get a table view (master) on the left and a detail view on the left.  However, when I run my code, the entire split view is filled with the table view.  How can I manually create a Split View layout?  Here are my three view controller classes, they're very simple...
MySplitViewController.m
MasterViewController.m
DetailViewController.m
What am I not understanding?
Thanks so much in advance for your wisdom!
P.S. It's worth noting why I'm not using the UISplitViewController.  My app is currently designed so that the root view is not split view.  The root view of my app will cause a split view to be pushed on to the nav stack.  The problem with this is that the UISplitViewController is designed to be the root view of an app and Apple's docs specifically say that if you use a UISplitViewController that it needs to be the root view.  Therefor, I'm implementing my own split view and manually managing the views.",12802998.0,2,1,,2012-10-09 14:55:34.257000+00:00,1.0,2012-10-09 15:03:47.183000+00:00,2017-05-23 10:24:54.270000+00:00,,-1.0,,191808.0,,1,1,iphone|ios|ipad|ios5,1618

The funny thing is when you try to isolate the problem it goes away , its only the interaction of particles that causes this.

the flickering stops completely. All that function does is declare a new sparks ... everything else is commented out.
All i can think of is that there is a floating point inaccuracy in particle sorting. it would be nice to have a 'SortingNeedsUpate' field on particle system, or that the sorting is only updated when the camera moves.

It works perfectly fine.
Now, the problem: a new requirement came to update 2 tables instead of one so I decided to add some transaction control:
Once again it works fine, but after I update the data (regardless if the process fails or succeeds), if I try to run the search procedure, I get this error:
  The operation could not be performed because OLE DB provider \""OraOLEDB.Oracle\"" for linked server \""LINKED_SERVER_NAME\"" was unable to begin a distributed transaction.""}
The only way I can make it work again is if I right click on the ASP.Net development Server and close it. It seems that it is keeping something open, but I checked the  DMV and I don't see any transactions open (I can see it if I debug into the method, but once the method is completed, no transaction is open)
FYI: the  objects are different form the select to the update and I also tried to add  but it didn't work either.
Any advise would be helpful thanks

12802535,Fusion table authentication lost when writing special character to a table field,"I am very new on google app scripts and fusion tables. I am developing a CRM app to my company and I am using google sites, google app scripts and fusion table to do that.
I am also using an example from the book ""Google Script - Enterprise Application Essentials"" from O'Reilly to build my app.
I am using Fusion table as a database to my project, and I run the function doOAuth() to give permission to everyone to perform the actions on fusion table.(See code below containing doOAuth code that i got from the book).
The app works fine for every command i make to the fusion table. I am able to read the content of the table, i am able to make a search on that as well, but when it comes to write new data or update existing data on the table I am facing an annoying problem.
I have some textboxes on my app on which I insert some datas, and those datas are written to the table, no problem so far, when I add common text to those textboxes I have no problem when updating data or inserting data to the fusion table. But when I add any special character to those textbox like: á,ã,à,ä,é,õ,í and so on, I receive a message telling me that it is needed authotization to perform that process. But I already gave the authorization. It seems that the authorization is lost. And even if I run the doOAuth() function again, the permission is not given. The insertFusionObj() and the writeFusionObj() functions (listed on the code below) seems to have a problem when their parameters are special characters. I don't know if that is a problem from the functions or if that is a fusion table insert and update problem.
I would really appreciate if someone could help me on that problem, because my app is intended to be used in portuguese language which have some special characters and when the person responsible for adding information to the app uses it, he will probably use special characters on insertion and update of the fusion table.
I am looking forward for some help .

12802530,How can I validate my Firefox extension's preferences?,"What is a generally accepted way to validate preference values in a Firefox extension, specifically when using the prefwindow mechanism in XUL?
I am introducing some new preferences in one of my extensions that I would like to validate before the preferences window is closed. If there's an error, the user should be allowed to correct the issue, and then proceed. I see that the  element has two potentially useful functions to help in this regard:
onbeforeaccept
ondialogaccept
The former seems to have an associated bug (Bug 474527) that prevents the  from remaining open when returning  from that function. This is bad in that it doesn't give the user an opportunity to immediately correct their mistake.
The latter appears to have the problem that the preferences get saved prior to exiting, which leaves the preferences in a bad state internally.
In addition, the  mechanism supports the  option, in which preference values are written immediately upon updating the associated control. This makes validation extra tricky. Is there a clean way to validate custom preferences in a Firefox extension, allowing the user to correct any potential mistakes?",12818776.0,2,0,,2012-10-09 14:40:51.973000+00:00,,2012-10-10 12:09:53.687000+00:00,2012-10-09 16:06:05.290000+00:00,,1128047.0,,1128047.0,,1,2,firefox|firefox-addon|xul,234

12802514,c# .net in-memory persistence,"I would like to have a ""user message"" available for every request sent back by the server. If there is not a user message, the message goes back blank. If there is one, an icon is activated on each user screen after their request is completed.
[edit]
The ""user message"" is something that is being set by an administrator for the application I'm deploying. The administrator can enter text into a field and click a button to send this message to every other user of the system. Any time another user performs any kind of action, the current user message is attached to the JSON response and handled by the front end.
In order to optimize this, I want the message to be stored in memory (not in the database).
I have tried to use static. I have tried to use HttpApplicationState. In both cases, the value of the user message is ""blanked out"" after some period of time. After some research, it appears that both statics and HttpApplicationState are subject to IIS and when it decides to recycle the application pool. (or some such)
This volatility of a static is mysterious: it should be static - so long as IIS itself lives, this variable should live. It should not be dependent on some kind of ""reset"" or whatever. The HttpApplicationState is some other situation that I don't fully understand.
I would like a way to store a value in a non-volatile variable that I can rely on. If I set this value today, it should be there tomorrow, or next week, so long as IIS is not stopped and restarted.
Any help?
here is what i have done to solve the problem as per the accepted answer below:
the user message is a sometime thing. so when the message gets set by some administrator, store the response in the database at that point in time and store it in the Application[""UserMessage""] object.
when round-trips from users come in, the in-memory text for the user message gets added to the json return value.
the message can be cleared by the administrator at any time, which clears both the in-memory message and the database field.
when IIS decides enough is enough and recycles the application, the Application_Start() method (among other tasks) will also re-seed the user message from the database value that was stored when the user message was set (as per step 1).
now the application works as expected. no extra price is paid going to the database for every user request into the system - the user message always comes from memory. in addition to this, the database is updated or loaded for the user message very few times.",12802640.0,2,4,,2012-10-09 14:40:03.930000+00:00,,2012-10-11 18:19:26.753000+00:00,2012-10-11 18:19:26.753000+00:00,,957628.0,,957628.0,,1,1,static|non-volatile|httpapplicationstate,1966

12802458,Extending entities in Symfony2 with Doctrine2,"I'm having trouble finding a way to appropriately extend an Entity across bundles in Symfony2 using Doctrine2 as the ORM.
Currently there are three methods that I've found to extending entities in Symfony2 using Doctrine2 as the ORM. ,  and . None of these work for what I'm looking to do.
I have two Bundles: UserBundle and BlogBundle. I want to be able to use the UserBundle in projects that do not have the BlogBundle, but the BlogBundle will always be used in projects that have the User Bundle. It's ok if the BlogBundle has dependencies on the UserBundle, but not the other way around.
I have two entities:
BlogBundle\Entity\Post and
UserBundle\Entity\User
Relationship:
There needs to be a One to Many relationship between Users and Blog Posts. This is achieved through a Author_ID property (column) on the BlogBundle\Entity\Post object (table) which is mapped to UserBundle\Entity\User.id
The Problem:
I can call the UserBundle\Entity\User entity directly from within the BlogBundle and achieve what I'm looking for using a Uni-Directional mapping. This does not allow me to access all posts by a user from within a User object. I can access the data via custom queries but this is not as clean as accessing posts by a user through the user object.
What I'd like to do is extend the UserBundle\Entity\User object from within the BlogBundle, and add the methods and properties to this object that establish the One to Many mapping used within the BlogBundle. None of this is persisted, it simply defines the relationship and allows me to logically access all posts created by a user in an application that implements both the BlogBundle and UserBundle by adding needed functionality to the User object within the blog bundle (thus avoiding a dependency from the UserBundle to the BlogBundle).
When I create a BlogBundle\Entity\User object and extend UserBundle\Entity\User I must declare @ORM\Table(name=""usertablename""). If I don't, any attempt to access the BlogBundle\Entity\User object will fail to access the database. Since none of the additions in the extended object persist, this works fine across bundles. The issue with this is when I call ""php app/console doctrine:schema:update --force"", there is a conflict since two entities try to map to &amp; create the same table. I have tried using the ResolveTargetEntityListener feature that was recently implemented but this, along with Mapped Superclas, STI and CTI all force a dependency on the BlogBundle from the UserBundle.
Below are my objects to help illustrate my my setup. They have been abbreviated for clarity. I realize some of the semantics aren't correct but it's intended to communicate the ideas &amp; configuration.
UserBundle\Entity\User
BlogBundle\Entity\Post
BlogBundle\Entity\User
This works but the problem is that I'm mapping two entities in the project to the same table. The extended object doesn't grab the @ORM\Table(name=""app_user"") from it's parent so it must be defined in BlogBundle\Entity\User. If not any reference to this object from a controller will not access the database. Since nothing is persisted from the extended object nothing is broken except for when I try to update the database schema from the console.
I can use a unidirectional relationship, but this limits how I can access the data from within a controller.",,2,1,,2012-10-09 14:37:32.267000+00:00,5.0,2015-05-12 16:50:33.240000+00:00,2012-10-09 14:42:14.417000+00:00,,1731809.0,,1731809.0,,1,13,symfony|doctrine-orm|entities|extending,17621

I am starting to get into caching to improve load times on page, and am also interested in keeping bandwidth usage down as these sites are hosted on our own VPS.
Right now I have Twitter and Facebook serializing/unserializing each to a simple data file, rewriting themselves every 10 minutes. Would it be better to write this data to the mySQL database? And if so, what is a good method for accomplishing this? 
Also, on the Twitter feed results, it contains only what I need, so it is nice and small (3 most recent tweets). But for Facebook, the result is larger and I sort through it with PHP for display - should I store THAT result or the raw feed? Does it matter?
For the other, larger JSON object, would the file vs mysql recommendation be the same?
I appreciate any insights and would be happy to show an example of the JSON schedule object if it makes a difference.

Both objects have identical structures; Functions: init, read, etc. and Properties: ID, etc.

My unexpected results are:
Both the ID for the child and the parentID are the same and are the parentID value when the object is returned. The childs variables.ID is overwritten after the super call. I assume that the variables scope is accessible by both, so when parent sets variables.ID it overwrites the child variables.ID. Can this be avoided without naming IDs differently?
The read function of the parent object does not appear to execute. If I rename the parents read function 'read2' for example, the function executes. I also suspect that the functions reside in a shared scope and therefore the childs read function is executing.

And every time I hit a button, it's fine. The data comes through as you would expect. Which is great!
The problem comes when I want to write to the device.
Following the sample simple_send file as a template (which was probably not the best choice), I would do the following:
Which would return a report object with a dictionary holding 4 entries. Is that correct? Do you write to a device using the output_reports object? Trying to do so by setting the report value to ANYTHING:
This would keep returning some obnoxious error that I can't interpret:
I'm using Windows 7. I've managed to find (finally) a reference for the HID DLL exported functions, and I don't HAVE to (or, for that matter even really WANT to) use the PyWinUSB library. I just want to make this work, and it didn't seem like it would be that tough, but it has been.

  In iOS, the regions you register with the location manager persist between launches of your application. If a region crossing occurs while your iOS app is not running, the system automatically wakes it up (or relaunches it) in the background so that it can process the event. When relaunched, all of the regions you configured previously are made available in the monitoredRegions property of any location manager objects you create.
I assume if the app is relaunched, iOS doesn't actually bring it to the foreground.  I couldn't find any good samples illustrating where  fits into an overall application, so my questions are:
Does one have to register the delegate for  from somewhere specific?  I'm guessing it can't be plonked in a view controller if we're launching the app without bringing it into the foreground.  Can someone give an example with some context around it?
If we decide we do want to bring the app into the foreground as a result of entering the region, how would we do so?
When is  registered with the OS and when is it unregistered?  Does the user have to have launched the app at least once (even if it's since been killed) for the initial registration to take place?  What about if the user powers off the device?  Will our handler be registered the next time the device is powered on, or will the user have to launch the app at least once again?",,1,1,,2012-10-09 14:29:11.490000+00:00,,2012-10-09 14:35:35.283000+00:00,,,,,129475.0,,1,3,objective-c|geolocation|cllocationmanager|lifecycle,777

HtmlImage.getHeight() or getWidth(). However it seems that in certain cases (maybe when the site is slow or something...) it takes 15 minutes for this call to return and, while it seems to recover ok, I dont really want to interrupt the thread either.

But I wanted to make enhancement, so I would get only result, where each category has only one image against, for example category 1, has image a71f4160d7f7f7555.jpg and category 6 has image 854b9faaa53d8fe02.jpg 
I bet, that I miss some basic knowledge, and simple enhancement with subquery and selecting MAX would work as a charm.

To reproduce:
I've created a new project, and installed Umbraco from Nuget (tried 4.7.1, 4.8.1 and 4.9.0 with same result), and SS from Nuget. I setup SS to run under the /api path in the web.config:
and added /api to reserved paths to avoid Umbraco handling this:
And in the AppHost.cs I've changed the EndpointHostConfig and enabled authentication:
And I've changed the connectionstring in ConfigureAuth to use the Umbraco database:
Finally I set the attribute on HelloWorldService:
I then access the HelloWorldService through REST Uri:
and right away I'm redirected to:
and presented with the default Umbraco 404 page, which means that SS suddenly makes Umbraco handle the authentication. If I remove the Authenticate attribute, SS handles the request perfectly.

When I set the font size of any node with CSS, no matter what measurement unit I choose (I tried both pt and px), font size is still set in pixels.
I also tried to set font for “Text” with the method “setFont”, which accepts parameter of type “Font”.
It is said in JavaFX2 documentation, that:
  The size of a Font is described as being specified in points which
  are a real world measurement of approximately 1/72 inch.
But the font size was still set in pixels.
For an experiment I added “WebView” to the scene and loaded a page in it, on which I displayed two div tags. Within the first div the font size was in pt, and within the second one – in px. As I had suggested, the font sizes were different, and the font size in the last div was identical to the font size in the nodes I referred to at the beginning.
Why is this happening? How do I set the font size in pt? At this moment to solve this problem I convert pt to px using this formula: px=pt/0.75 (dpi of my screen is 96).

Microsoft introduces a  function in IE 10 which will achieve this.
Open the Blob URL in the browser and save it that way.
None of these seems to work in Safari though. While (1) works in Chrome, (2) in IE and (3) in Firefox no one works in Safari 6. The download attribute is not yet implemented and when trying to open a blob using the URL Safari complains that URLs starting with  are not valid URLs.
There is a good script that encapsulates (1) and (3) called FileSaver.js but that does not work using the latest Safari version.

I have implemented the solution proposed by Brad Larson ( I will be always thankful to him, I think he is doing a great job for the community sharing so much knowledge...) in Faster alternative to glReadPixels in iPhone OpenGL ES 2.0
Everything seems to work, I get the proper data and if I compare it with glReadPixels, the data is identical. 
My problem came when I measure the performance of this 2 possible solutions (consumed time while retrieving the data). 
Here my results :
(framebuffer and texture size 320x480 pixels)

GPUImageProcessingDemo[1252:707] Texture reading 1276 us

GPUImageProcessingDemo[1252:707] glReadPixels 2494 us
GPUImageProcessingDemo[1252:707] Texture reading 1375 us
Which seems very interesting since it is almost half of the time needed when using glReadPixels.
The problem is when I change the texture size to something a little bit bigger I get this results:

Is that possible? Is there a tool (or a set of tools) which I can use to do so?

I want it to be flexible in such a way that I could use PHP or Java with it. After intensive googling I found Droptiles (droptiles.com) by Omar Al Zabir. Since I was also thinking of incorporating the Windows Live Tiles look and functionality in my mobile web site, I think that it is a good choice.  My question is what are the HTML5 features which are supported by Droptiles?  I need to know this before commiting to this framework.  So far reading its documentation I have not read of any html5 feature.  I hope people with experience using Droptiles could answer my question.  Thanks in advance.
By the way the html5 features that I consider as deal breakers are
offline storage
support for viewport meta tag ( or anything that would allow it to scale depending on the device used)

12801974,Best Data Caching Strategy for Asp.Net Mvc and SqlServer,"Users can do CRUD operations for web application mostly. But the situation is different for my specific web application. Users never do CUD. They can only Retrieve data.
So the picture:
1- There is a service updating database frequently (7-8 updates per second)(Scheduling framework is Quartz.Net)
2- Sql Server 2008 R2
3- Asp.Net MVC 4 ( The web users can only read data from Sql Server!) 
Requirement: Web Users never get data from Sql Server!
Strategy A: (Code Name: The Host is Web App)
1- Calling service library from Asp.Net MVC, so we can update database and cache transactionally
2- Web users can read from cache
3- On App_Start we update cache data from sql server.
4- Time based application pool recycling is closed
Strategy B: (Code Name: Web Pipe)
1- Service runs as exe.
2- Service does not make Sql Update, it sends web requests to Asp.Net MVC Application.
3- So Asp.Net MVC application (Controller's Action) does update and cache transactionally
4- On App_Start we update cache data from sql server.
5- Time based application pool recycling is closed
For both scenerio the web users never get data from SqlServer. They always read data from cache.

Compared to the posts listed on the Facebook Feed, some (public) posts aren't returned at all. What's the reason for this? (As i said, I'm using the limit parameter in a  call)

12801935,Get IPv4 addresses of an ethernet adapter in Windows using Java 1.5,"Problem
My Windows system has multiple ethernet adapters. Given the name of an ethernet adapter, I need to find its IP addresses.

12801926,Design Pattern for DAO tests with jUnit,"I am looking for a best practice to test a DAO class with jUnit. My DAO class has a couple of typical DAO methods like createUser(User user), deleteUser(Long id), updateUser(User user), findUserById(Long id)...
So createUser could be easy, I could create a user and check if it has an id afterwards. If yes the test would pass. 
Or would you rather create a User, read the User from the DB afterwards and check if it 
1) finds the user
2) the instance variables from the returned user are the same like from the user saved before
Now what about the deleteUser function? It takes an ID, but in order to obtain the ID I would first have to create a User. So how to do this? Use the testCreateUser method from the test method or the createUser method from the DAO class?
Same thing with updateUser(User user) where I need a User to be updated first and findUserById(Long id) where I need an Id first. 
I think my requirement is pretty common so I am wondering if there is something like a design pattern for testing DAOs with jUnit.

I am storing these messages in an in-memory data structure (say List). I want to write those messages to a file but only after list size reaches some threshold value say 100 messages (perform batch processing on the messages).
One way is I can simply check the list size after every message is received and call a function to write messages to a file if Threshold value is reached. But the problem with this approach is: 
Calling function may need to wait indefinitely until all the messages are written to the file
The incoming messages may be lost in the process or might need to wait for getting stored in the List.   
Other way could be to spawn a new thread, which will write messages to a file independently. But when I pass the list (containing messages) to the thread for performing write operation, it gets updated with new messages which are continuously coming in. As a result newly arrived messages also gets written to the file which is not expected.

.. afterwards in MyManagedBeanELResolver's revoleBean (registered in faces-config.xml as el-resolver) method:
Is there a better solution to it?
UPDATE why I can't use the PhaseListener proposed by kolossus
I cannot use the viewId to fetch the ManagedBean because I would like to have n types of Bean currently active, each accessed by their bean name.
I have a 1:n relation between viewId and ManagedBean, e.g. I have a test.jsf which has the backing-bean TestBean. It's also possible that a TestBean0 exists which is the, lets say, a copy of TestBean but with a different value (which I need to inject, e.g. a ""userId""). My test.jsf (together with a ControllerBean is able to determine which ManagedBean should be accessed, either the TestBean or TestBean0, which shows either the content from the TestBean (e.g. userId=27) or *TestBean_0* (e.g. userId=33).
This allows me to have the 1 view (test.jsf) with n models (TestBean) displayed at in the same page at the same time, e.g my test.html looks like this.
So therefore I can have a recursion (depth of the recursion is 1 in this case), where the outputText from the level 0 shows the name ""Your userId is 27"" and the included test.xhtml's outputText shows ""Your userId is 33"".",17207319.0,1,0,,2012-10-09 13:53:00.070000+00:00,,2013-06-20 07:06:57.747000+00:00,2013-06-20 07:05:58.493000+00:00,,1731935.0,,1731935.0,,1,1,java|jsf|jsf-2|managed-bean,223

  This is very reminiscent of a big if else tree in imperative languages, only this is far better and more readable. While big if else trees are usually frowned upon, sometimes a problem is defined in such a discrete way that you can't get around them. Guards are a very nice alternative for this.

12801604,Strategy for model entities in ASP.NET MVC,"A part of the web application I'm building is user administration. Thus I have the need for a user entity. There are several use cases that involves a user, for example:
Show a list of users
Show a single user
Edit user contact information
Edit user login information (username and password)
Create a new user
Most of these needs access to the same properties so it would be nice to use the same entity for all cases. Then, if I use for example DisplayName attribute, all places would use the same display name:
When editing a user, I want to use validation attributes as well:
The problem occurs when I have a view where some properties are edited, but not all. In the ""Edit user contact information"" use case, some things are available for editing (e.g. PhoneNumber) but some are not (e.g. Username). But if I use the same entity, all properties with validation attributes will be validated.
I've found some solutions to the validation problem here on StackOverflow, but I'm wondering if there are any ""best practises"" when creating entities and viewmodels?
I prefer to re-use as much as possible to make sure that for example display names and validation is consistent throughout the application. But often that leads to problems such as the one described above or complex inheritance hiearchies.
Should I have:
Several similiar (but not identical) entities?
Several similiar (but not identical) viewmodels?
One entity + workarounds for problems such as the validation problem?
...
Any suggestions? How do you do this yourself?
I should note that I often show more information than just what is being edited. For example, when editing contact information I will have inputs for some properties (e.g. PhoneNumber and EmailAddress) but still show other properties as information to the user (e.g. Username).

12801458,Find list of users based on recorded entries,"For me the scenario is hard to explain, but I would like to get a list of users (actually ""patients"") which are ready for a dismissal meeting.
THE SITUATION
I have a patient table:
The patient follows a special process, where I have defined phases:
And I log all the phases of the patient:
The term ""ready for a meeting"" means the meeting is planned. Such planned meetings are logged in a message table. The message for a planned meeting has a type ""meeting_planned"" and for example when the meeting is done, there is a new message ""meeting_done"".
MY QUERY
I am looking for a query now which I really cannot come up with. My logic is:
Select all patients;
Where the last status (based on timestamp) is from phase name ""C"" or ""D"";
Where there is no message with the type meeting_planned.
Ad 2: the patient can be either in one of the two phases. When a patient is in phase A, B, E or F then a meeting cannot be planned. A nurse may decide to plan the meeting already when patient is in phase C, but if that did not happened, it will occur at phase D (D always follows C, it is A>B>C>D>E>F).
Ad 3: there might be other messages, but never with this type. There is a unique constaint here on type+patient_id. If a meeting has been planned and has happened, there are two messages (type 1 = meeting_planned, type 2 = meeting_done). If there hasn't been a meeting planned, the type meeting_planned does not occur, but other messages might be set already.
WHAT HAVE I TRIED
I came up with this query now:
MY QUESTIONS
In above query I have two things I cannot manage:
I have patients double in the list. Any patient in phase D also occurs as a patient in phase C (so double). I tried a  but that didn't work out
I now exclude phases based on their name, but I would like to order phases on the timestamp from the status and only look at the last status from there

I'm using a service reference in Visual Studio in order to discuss with a webservice. To do that, I integrate the WSDL the owner of the webservice give it to me.

But when i use a HTTP sniffer (Fiddler), I see the SOAP answer in the HTTP packet. So, if I must explain properly the problem, it seems the pipe between transport layer and software layer is broken.

The images loop. When I click the prev or next button, the JS change the source of the image, and load the next one. The code works.
And now my problem. 
I want to fade in every new image when it is fully loaded, to achieve a nicer effect and I'm not able to make it work. The code I put together from various sources works only for the first image.
I really want the code to be simple, because my knowledge of Jquery is really basic. I've searched the site and I find a lot of similar problems and solutions, but none worked for me.
ADDED 10. oct. 2012: @jbabey gave a good answer for my basic question (see below), but then another problem came up. When I click the nex/prev button and the new image is waiting to be loaded (and fade in) the container of the image shrinks. I understand that this is because the new image is hidden until it's fully loaded. But is there a way to change the JS, that it ""remembers"" the container height of the first loaded image (the basic image that loads on page load). So when I click prev/next the container of the image retains the height of the previous image. I can't set the height of the container, because of the page design.
Any help would be appreciated.

12801244,webbrowser control within class library executing RDS-can't change internet settings and trusted site does not work,"I have been working on this problem for a week:
I have a class library that hosts a .net webbrowser control.  This webbrowser control kicks off a vbscript which uses RDS technology to communicate with a database.  Everthing works fine if I change my internet options to 'allow datasources accross domains'.  However, this is not an option when deployment happens due to obvious security concerns.  The problem then is getting the solution to work WITHOUT changing the global ie settings.  
Things I have tried:
*Adding the site that we access via RDS to our 'trusted sites' (didn't make a difference)
*Researched the custom security manager for the webbrowser control 
*To find any other way to make this work besides the custom security manager since documentation seems lacking and it is tricky to implement
Where I need help:
The custom security manager seems to be the way to go but I am having to pull from multiple posts and there seem to be gaps in how to implement it with c# in the .net framework.  I am having some trouble getthing started here.  I think if I had some footing of namespaces and project references that I might be able to use some other posts I have found which seem to provide the coding portion of the IInternetSecurityManager.  There seems to be a need to override a base class, then inherit that from another base class, but I am having trouble there.  So I need helping getting started if possible, and then be able to ask questions along the way after I get going.  
What I would like to understand
It seems the webbrowser control is not safe for scripting, so that it doesn't EXACTLY mimic IE.  I wonder if there is a way to up the permissions on my class library, or register it, or give more permissions to the webbrowser control without having to implement the custom security manager?

Socket.io and Session?
As you can see when you visit the 3rd link, it's a link to StackOverflow. There was a good answer, but as pointed out in those comments by @UpTheCreek, connect no longer has the parseCookie method. I have just run into this problem as well. All of the tutorials I have found uses connect's  method which now doesn't exist. So I asked him how we can get the session data and he said he doesn't know the best approach so I thought I'd post the question here. When using , , and , how can we get session data and use that to authorize the user? I've been able to use , but when I do that, I always get a warning/error when handshaking, 
and from what I've read it sounds like that isn't a permanent solution anyways.
UPDATE
Ok I got  working on my server. And as I suspected, I got stuck at the point of authorizing. I think I might be going about this the wrong way, so feel free to correct me. In my Redis database, I will have user's information. The first time that they login, I want to update their cookie so it contains their user information. Then the next time they come back to the site, I want to check if they have a cookie and if the user information is there. If it is not there, I want to send them to the login screen. At the login screen, when a user submits information, it would test that information against the Redis database, and if it matches, it would update the cookie with user information. My questions are these: 
1) How can I update/change a cookie through RedisStore? 
2) It looks like session data is saved only in cookies. How can I keep track of user information from page to page if someone has cookies turned off?

The google services is simple as I can ask for a token to the AccountManager (or even simpler the GoogleAccountManager) and ask for a token via  if it's the first time, it will prompt the user to authorise and all further access the AccountManager will deal with any token renew, etc and just give me back the token.
But for WebView based authentications (facebook, twitter, instagram) I'm doing the commonly popular method of opening a webview, let the user authorise it, use localhost as the redirect_url and use a WebViewClient to intercept the call, capture the token, and finish the webview.
Up to this point everything is working fine!
The problem I'm facing is that tokens expire! That way after a token expires there will be another popup of the webview, the service will load, hopefully immediately authorise (because the service remembers that the user already authorised it), redirect to localhost and the WebViewClient intercept and close it.
So now imagine the user coming back to an app after a week or so without using it and see several little quick pop up in a row? Terrible user experience to say the least.

12800822,"C++ (MFC) app with CWebBrowser2 -> ChromeFrame -> HTML5 app, how to get click events from the HTML5 to the C++ app?","We have a legacy C++ (MFC) application. One part of it hosts a CWebBrowser2 object in which we navigate to a url which is a new module we're developing to add to our application.
The module is an HTML5 application. Since CWebBrowser2 uses IE (currently IE8) the URL we pass to it loads Chrome Frame and passes to that another URL which is our module.
So, the url is something like this (note: user cannot input this, it's configured by us per-site):
Inside ChromeFrameWrapper.htm we have code that will grab the url, take the portion after the first ? and set chromeFrame.src to that, thus our module shows up nicely within our C++ application.
Now the problem. Within this HTML5 module we have some navigation buttons (note: it could be an anchor if that's what's needed). What we want to have happen is when the user clicks one of these buttons, the main application (C++ MFC app) is notified of the click.
Since there are several buttons we need to know which button it was as we will navigate to different locations within the C++ app based on what's clicked (we do have reasons for this, it's just step one in our complete replacement of the C++ app).
In the C++ app I'm able to obtain the IHTMLDocument2 object and the collection of tags, however this is for the ChromeFrameWrapper HTML. That's as far as I've been able to go so far.
Would it even be possible to hook something up so our C++ app is able to receive events of the clicks from the HTML5 module?
If so, how? I'm stuck and haven't been able to find any examples involving Chrome Frame hosted HTML and events. Is using the MSHTML the right way, or is there something else?
Here's the SCRIPT and main HTML for ChromeFrameWrapper.htm. Note, we're trying to prove it works so no code critique unless it solves my problem.

How to create a  which contains a custom-format string serialization of an object in a way that editing the string updates the model and vice versa?

Long Question:
Prequel
I have a object which is my application’s “master model”. it can be serialized to a string of a specific format:
it has 2-3 attributes, whose serializations are joined by “;” (no trailing “;” if the third is missing)
attributes 2 and 3 are lists of objects, and serialized by joining those with “,”.
the serialization of the objects is just one of their string attributes, or two ow them with “x” between.
so i have a constructor (accepting a spec string), and a  function. Following; the latter for clarity:
The directive i tried to use looks thusly, but the  only fires once.
Actual long question
What i want is an easy way to make this work,

I then, in code, workout what I scale I need for the current device. For example if the current device is 1024x512 (an arbitrary res), I know to scale all graphics by 50%.
This has generally worked well, however (as I am sure some of you have guessed by now), the problem arises with the smaller graphics on small screens. Specifically I have a font that when scaled down to work with a new xperia mini (medium res but small physical dimensions), doesn't look nice.
So what I want is to use the various drawable folders to provide a graphics for ""exception"" cases only. That is, I don't want to create ldpi, mdpi, hdpi etc versions of every single graphic but rather I want to use the default graphics for most and then the specific graphics for things like this font.
The problem I have is because the other graphics still need to be scaled down based on this default size, these specific graphics are also being scaled down when they don't need to be.
Does anyone have any advice on how I can go about resolving this? Or perhaps there is a way for me to tell that the android system has selected this graphics from the mdpi folder (so that I can then manually decide what I want to do with it)?

There is any way to handle/fix this situation?

My idea is to create the session when the user makes an ajax call. With this situation, the first time i call the ""example"" function it doesnt work. The second it goes ok, i think because the session was created.

but my question is 
  By default, table.sort uses &lt; to compare array elements, so it can
  only sort arrays of numbers or arrays of strings. Write a comparison
  function that allows table.sort to sort arrays of mixed types. In the
  sorted array, all values of a given type should be grouped together.
  Within each such group, numbers and strings should be sorted as usual,
  and other types should be sorted in some arbitrary but consistent way.
as i said i solved this using different for loops but is there a way to just analyse every element of the table then assign it to a different Table??? Like : ""Tables,Funcs,Nums,Strings,..."" then after analysing finished just concatenate them together to have the same table just in sorted version.

12800600,Grails / IntelliJ setup with multiple modules,"I am currently defining the project structure for a project that I am working on. The project is a simple SOA implementation and as such has a grails app and a number of different services.
I wanted to package these services into separate modules (jars) so that they can easily be deployed separately and there is no risk of cost-contamination of classes.
The project structure and dependancies could be visualised as:
Whilst these services will eventually be deployed seperately, for ease of local development I want to package them into a single grails app until such time as it is necessary to break them apart.
My ultimate goal was to be able to develop these services in the same way I would a simple grails app in that I would be able to change any class (within any of the modules) on the fly and have it picked up.
I am struggling though to see the best way in IntelliJ to represent this structure. 
I had created seperate modules for each of the above and added the dependancies between them, but obviously grails has no idea of this at runtime.
I have read about and found the following possible solutions, all of which currently feel a bit unsatisfactory as would require a jar to be built meaning that classes cannot be reloaded on the fly.
Install the modules into the local maven repository and reference this in the grails build dependancies.
Drop the built jars into the lib directory.
Add them as grails plugins (seems a little heavy handed as they won't require grails functionality).
Find some other way of including the output directories for these modules on the grails classpath (not sure of the cleanest way to do this).
