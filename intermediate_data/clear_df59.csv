<p>On a few occasions recently, I've wanted to design and code a Form object that I could plug into several other ""parent"" forms.  My goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several UI components in a particular way, and then be able to use that (both the UI layout and the logic) in more than one place.  I'm certainly willing to use code (rather than the Design View) to load the child form.</p>

<p>The best I've come up with so far is to pull all of the interesting logic for the child form into a Class Module, and have each parent form lay out the UI (in a Picture control, perhaps) and pass that Picture object into the class module.  The class then knows how to operate on the picture, and it assumes that all its expected pieces have been laid out appropriately.

I think I managed to lose the gist of my question, and maybe it's really two.</p>

<p>With embedded programming you may need types of specific size for interfaces and also to cope with restricted resources such as RAM.  This can't be avoided, but you can choose to use the basic types from the compiler.</p>

<p>For everything else the types have less importance.<br>
You need to be careful not to cause overflow and may need to watch out for register and stack usage.  Which may lead you to <code>UINT16</code>, <code>UCHAR</code>.
Using types such as <code>UCHAR</code> can add compiler 'fluff' however.  Because registers are typically larger, some compilers may add code to force the result into the type.<br>

You have to do this from a command prompt (or a batch file) because Windows Explorer doesn't let you view the relevant subdirectory of c:\windows\assembly.</p>

<p>However, if you do this, the next time you try to deploy the workflow from within Visual Studio, it complains that it can't be deployed because ""the file may not be signed"" and if you attempt to copy the new version of the dll into the GAC, it tells you that the .dll file is locked.</p>

<p>I've found that some of the time, you can get round this by doing an iisreset, but on other occasions you have to restart Visual Studio and there have been frequent times when I've even had to reboot the computer altogether because some mystery process has locked the file. When I don't use the debugger, on the other hand, everything works just fine.</p>

<p>@Chris</p>

<p>A good point, but there are reasons I want it to resize. I want the area it takes up to be the area of the information contained in it. As you can see in the screen shot, if I have a fixed textarea, it takes up a fair wack of vertical space.</p>

<p>I can reduce the font, but I need address to be large and readable. Now I can reduce the size of the text area, but then I have problems with people who have an address line that takes 3 or 4 (one takes 5) lines. Needing to have the user use a scrollbar is a major no-no.</p>

<p>I guess I should be a bit more specific. I'm after vertical resizing, and the width doesn't matter as much. The only problem that happens with that, is the ISO number (the large ""1"") gets pushed under the address when the window width is too small (as you can see on the screenshot).</p>

<p>It's not about having a gimick; it's about having a text field the user can edit that won't take up unnecessary space, but will show all the text in it.</p>

<p>Yes, windows mobile does not have an actual mouse, but you are mistaken that Windows Mobile .NET do not support the Mouse events.  A click or move on the screen is still considered a ""Mouse"" event.  It was done this way so that code could port over from full Windows easily.  And this is not a Windows Mobile specific issue.  The TextBox control on Windows does not have native mouse events either.  I just happened to be using Windows Mobile in this case.</p>

<p>Edit:  And on a side note...as Windows Mobile is built of the WindowsCE core which is often used for embedded desktop systems and Slim Terminal Services clients or ""WinTerms"" it has support for a hardware mouse and has for a long time.

<p>Actually, that's only there because it inherits it from ""Control"", as does <em>every</em> other Form control.  It is, however, overridden (and changed to private I believe) in the TextBox class.  So it will not show up in IntelliSense in Visual Studio.</p>

<p>However, you actually can write the code:</p>

<pre><code>textBox1.MouseDown += new System.Windows.Forms.MouseEventHandler(this.textBox1_MouseDown);
</code></pre>

<p>and it will compile and run just fine, the only problem is that textBox1_MouseDown() will not be fired when you tap the TextBox control.  I assume this is because of the Event being overridden internally.  I don't even want to change what's happening on the event internally, I just want to add my own event handler to that event so I can fire some custom code as you could with any other event.</p>",Capture MouseDown event for .NET TextBox,Capture MouseDown event for .NET TextBox

7937,"<p>When using IE, you cannot put an absolutely positioned div over a select input element. That's because the select element is considered an ActiveX object and is on top of every HTML element in the page.</p>

<p>I already saw people hiding selects when opening a popup div, that leads to pretty bad user experience having controls disappearing.</p>

<p>FogBugz actually had a pretty smart solution (before v6) of turning every select into text boxes when a popup was displayed. This solved the bug and tricked the user eye but the behavior was not perfect.</p>

<p>Last solution I currently use is messing up the IE rendering engine and force it to render the absolutely positioned <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> as an ActiveX element too, ensuring it can live over a select element.

For instance, <code>CWinApp::Run</code>.  This may be a good solution but I haven't looked at any perf or stability implications.

<p>Update:
@Lars - I do use Enyim actually - it's very good, but what you're referring to is a client, rather than the server part.</p>

<p>@DannySmurf - I've only been able to install it as a service on a 32 bit OS. 64 bit OS rejects the installation of this Win32 service. Of course yes, lots of Win32 code works seamlessly on x64 architecture, hence you can run 32bit apps (like Office for instance) or games on Vista/XP 64 etc, but this doesn't translate directly when it comes to services. I'm no expert, I suspect that it has to do with the syncs or eventing that services need to subscribe to, and I suspect that 64 and 32 don't play nicely. I'm happy to be corrected on any of this, but to answer your question - yes I have tried.</p>

<p>@OJ - thanks very much for the straight-forward response. I thought as much, but wasn't sure if anyone else had suggestions or had already gone down this route. Maybe when StackOverflow is LIVE, then more people will respond and let me know if this is something being looked into, and although I can try and compile it myself - I simply can't ""trust"" (with my C++ experience level) that it would provide ""Enterprise Level"" reliability in such a crucial component of large scalable solutions.

8939,"<p>I'm having trouble connecting (via the Socket and XMLSocket classes) to a TCP listener after a connect timeout.</p>

<p>I have a flash applet that needs to maintain a TCP connection to a server. I have implemented timeouts using Timers, a ping-pong system, etc. However, there's a problem. Upon calling Socket.connect(), the flash player (9.0.115 and many other stables before that) sends 3 connection requests by way of SYN packets, with some time in between. If none of those are replied to (e.g. because the server is down), I cannot get the applet to [attempt to] connect to the server. Ever. That is, within the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>To clarify and/or summarize:</p>

<p>For any host/port pair given to Socket.connect() or XMLSocket.connect(), if the call fails, any subsequent connect() calls to any other Socket (or XMLSocket) instances <strong>within the lifetime of the Flash applet</strong> to the same host/port pair get ignored. (At least as far as I can tell using a packet sniffer.)</p>

<p>I have tried calling numerous Socket methods, destroying¹ and recreating the objects, using a pool of Sockets, and various other methods I can't remember right now; all to no avail.</p>

<p>My current solution is to notify the parent webpage through a JavaScript call and let it reload my applet. It's not a pretty solution, and I'm not about to implement workarounds for the problems <em>it</em> causes, just because Flash can't handle socket connections properly.</p>

<p>I must be missing something very simple.</p>

<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>1: I know you can't really destroy objects; I just remove all references to them and hope for the best. I haven't tried to explicitly invoke the GC in this case. (Though I think I did try putting the Socket inside an Array and using <em>delete</em>.)</p>

<hr>

<p>Yes, it works as expected if the connection is successful (even if the connection drops later on.)</p>

<p>The only event to trigger this is the case when the server doesn't respond at all; it's as if Flash marks the host/port combination as ""offline"" and doesn't bother sending any more packets to it for the lifetime of the applet.</p>

<p>I suspect an active refusal of the connection (e.g. host is online but not listening to the port) doesn't cause this.</p>

<p>I get no error message or feedback of any other kind from the Socket.</p>

<h2>Code added to the generic class</h2>

{
    // Get the TypeCode from the Primitive Type
    TypeCode code = Type.GetTypeCode(typeof(PrimitiveDataType));

    // All of the TypeCode Enumeration refer Primitive Types

    // all we need to check for is Object!

    {
        case TypeCode.Object:
            return false;
        default:
            return true;
    }
}

<p>Then a little utility method to check the type and throw an exception,</p>
<pre><code>private void EnforcePrimitiveType()
{
    if (!TypeValid())
        throw new InvalidOperationException(
            &quot;Unable to Instantiate SimpleMetadata based on the Generic Type of '&quot; + typeof(PrimitiveDataType).Name + 
            &quot;' - this Class is Designed to Work with Primitive Data Types Only.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>All that then needs to be done is to call <em>EnforcePrimitiveType()</em> in the classes constructors. Job done! :-)</p>
<p>The only one downside, it only throws an exception at runtime (obviously) rather than design time.. But that's no big deal and could be picked up with utilities like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FxCop"" rel=""noreferrer"">FxCop</a> (which we don't use at work).</p>

9173,"<p>My C# project - we'll call it the SuperUI - used to make use of a class from an external assembly. Now it doesn't, but the compiler won't let me build the project without the assembly reference in place. Let me elaborate.</p>

<p>This project used to throw and catch a custom exception class - the <code>SuperException</code> - which was derived from the standard System.Exception and lived in a separate, precompiled assembly, <code>SuperAssembly.DLL</code>, which I referenced.</p>

<p>Eventually, I decided this was a pointless exercise and replaced all <code>SuperExceptions</code> with a System.SuitableStandardException in each case. I removed the reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, but am now met with the following on trying to compile the project:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The type 'SuperException' is defined in an assembly that is not referenced. You must add a reference to assembly 'SuperException, Version=1.1.0.0 (...)'</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The source file referenced by the error doesn't seem relevant; it's the project namespace that gets highlighted in the IDE.</p>

<p>Now, here's the thing:</p>

<ol>
<li>All uses of <code>SuperException</code> have been eliminated from the project's code.</li>
<li>Compared to another project that compiles fine without a reference to <code>SuperException.DLL</code>, I only reference one more assembly - and <code>that</code> references nothing that my project doesn't reference itself. While it's possible that any of these dependencies could throw <code>SuperExceptions</code>, I'm only catching the base Exception class and in any case... the other project builds fine!</li>
<li>I've done Visual Studio's ""Clean Solution"" and cleared everything out by hand, many times.</li>

9191,"<p>I'd like to ask a question then follow it up with my own answer, but also see what answers other people have.</p>

<p>We have two large files which we'd like to read from two separate threads concurrently.  One thread will sequentially read fileA while the other thread will sequentially read fileB.  There is no locking or communication between the threads, both are sequentially reading as fast as they can, and both are immediately discarding the data they read.</p>

<p>Our experience with this setup on Windows is very poor.  The combined throughput of the two threads is in the order of 2-3 MiB/sec.  The drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files, presumably reading very little after each seek.</p>

<p>If we disable one of the threads and temporarily look at the performance of a single thread then we get much better bandwidth (~45 MiB/sec for this machine).  So clearly the bad two-thread performance is an artefact of the OS disk scheduler.</p>

<p><strong>Is there anything we can do to improve the concurrent thread read performance?</strong>  Perhaps by using different APIs or by tweaking the OS disk scheduler parameters in some way.</p>

<p>Some details:</p>

<p>The files are in the order of 2 GiB each on a machine with 2GiB of RAM.  For the purpose of this question we consider them not to be cached and perfectly defragmented.  We have used defrag tools and rebooted to ensure this is the case.</p>

<p>We are using no special APIs to read these files.  The behaviour is repeatable across various bog-standard APIs such as Win32's CreateFile, C's fopen, C++'s std::ifstream, Java's FileInputStream, etc.</p>

<p>Each thread spins in a loop making calls to the read function.  We have varied the number of bytes requested from the API each iteration from values between 1KiB up to 128MiB.  Varying this has had no effect, so clearly the amount the OS is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number.  This is exactly what should be expected.</p>

<p>The dramatic difference between one-thread and two-thread performance is repeatable across Windows 2000, Windows XP (32-bit and 64-bit), Windows Server 2003, and also with and without hardware RAID5.</p>",How to obtain good concurrent read performance from disk,How to obtain good concurrent read performance from disk

9240,"<p>Say you have an application divided into 3-tiers: GUI, business logic, and data access. In your business logic layer you have described your business objects: getters, setters, accessors, and so on... you get the idea. The interface to the business logic layer guarantees safe usage of the business logic, so all the methods and accessors you call will validate input. </p>

<p>This great when you first write the UI code, because you have a neatly defined interface that you can trust.</p>

<p>But here comes the tricky part, when you start writing the data access layer, the interface to the business logic does not accommodate your needs. You need to have more accessors and getters to set fields which are/used to be hidden.

<p>Prod has a single virtualized (vmware) web server with two CPUs and 2 GB of RAM.  The database server has 4GB, and 2 CPUs as well.  It's also on VMWare, but separate physical hardware.</p>

<p>During normal usage the application runs fine.  The w3wp.exe process normally uses betwen 5-20% CPU and around 200MB of RAM.  CPU and RAM fluctuate slightly under normal use, but nothing unusual.</p>

<p>However, when we start running into problems, the RAM climbs dramatically and the CPU pegs at 98% (or as much as it can get).  The site becomes unresponsive, necessitating a IIS restart.  Resetting the app pool does nothing in this situation, a full IIS restart is required.</p>

<p>It does not happen during the night (no usage).  It happens more when the site is under load, but it has also happened under non-peak periods.</p>

<p>First step to solving this problem is reproducing it. To simulate the load, we starting using JMeter to simulate usage. Our load script is based on actual usage around the time of the crash.  Using JMeter, we can ramp the usage up quite high (2-3 times the load during the crash) but the site behaves fine.  CPU is up high, and the site does become sluggish, but memory usage is reasonable and nothing is hanging.</p>

9615,"<p>I need to display some interactive (attaching with DOM listeners etc. and event handling) vector graphics in web site I am working on. There is a W3C recommendation for SVG though this format is still not recognized by Internet Explorer support of which is a must (for a public website). IE handles VML though and there are even javascript libraries that do some canvas-like drawing depending on a browser (SVG vs. VML) - <a href=""http://excanvas.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""noreferrer"" title=""excanvas"">excanvas</a>, <a href=""http://dojotoolkit.org/book/dojo-book-0-9/part-3-programmatic-dijit-and-dojo/drawing-gfx"" rel=""noreferrer"">GFX of Dojo Toolkit</a> and more. That would be nice and acceptable though none of them can display an SVG image from the given markup.</p>

<p>So the question actually consists of several parts:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any cross-browser Javascript libraries that display vector graphics from given markup (not obligatory SVG) and offer availability to attach to DOM events?</li>
<li>If there are not, which of the most pupular browser-embedded technologies would be most suitable for doing such a task? I can choose from Flex/Flash, Java applet. Silverlight is not an option because of Windows lock-in.</li>
</ol>

<p>[<strong>EDIT</strong>] Thank you all for your comments/suggestions. Below are just some my random notes/conclusions on this matter:</p>

<ul>
<li>The level of interactivity I need is ability to detect DOM events on the vector image being displayed - mouseover, mouseout, click etc. - and ability to react on them like changing background color, displaying dialog etc.</li>
<li>The idea of sticking with SVG format is quite well as it is native on many browsers except the most popular one - IE. After some experimenting with displaying dynamic SVG I realized that IE version 7 the most problematic. There's too much hassle because of browser incompatibilities.</li>
<li>Cake seems a great Javascript framework, though I could not get the examples working on IE7.</li>
<li>Java Applets - I liked that idea the most as I though I could use the Apache Batik library, a quality SVG renderer. However, Batik is very big library and I cannot afford deploying an applet that weights few megabytes.</li>
<li>I decided to stick with the Flex option. I found a nice vector graphics library <a href=""http://www.degrafa.com/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Degrafa</a>. It uses its own markup format however it recognizes SVG path notation, so in my case it is going to be quite easy to transform my SVGs using XSLT or just parsing them.</li>
</ul>

<p>[<strong>EDIT 2</strong>] Some more comments appeared. I'd like to clarify that by ""Windows lock-in"" I mean the situation that Silverlight would normally run on Windows, more specifically, IE. I doubt it is an accepted solution (like Flash or Java Applet, for instance) on other systems. Yes, I have no doubt that one <em>is able to</em> launch Silverlight app on any system though I fear it would be too much effort for an average user.</p>

9629,"<p>I have got the following situation. On a machine there is a <strong>Fritz ISDN</strong> card. There is a process that is responsible for playing a certain wave file on this device's wave out (<strong>ISDN</strong> connection is made at startup and made persistent). The scenario is easy, whenever needed the process calls <code>waveOutWrite()</code> on the previously opened wave device (everything initialized without any problems of course) and a callback function waits for <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> msg to know that the playback has been finished. </p>

<p>Since a few days however (nothing changed neither in the process nor the machine) the <code>MM_WOM_DONE</code> message has been coming immediately after calling <code>waveOutWrite()</code> even though the wave lasts a couple of seconds. Again no error is reported, it looks like the file was played but had zero length (which is not the case). I am also sure that <code>waveOutReset()</code> was not called by my process (it would also trigger sending the mentioned message). I have already used to have some strange problems in the past that where solved simply by reinstalling <strong>TAPI</strong> drivers. This time for some reason it is problematic for me to perform that once again and I am trying more analytical approach :). Any suggestions what might cause such a behavior?

9675,"<p>I'm implementing a document server. Currently, if two users open the same document, then modify it and save the changes, the document's state will be undefined (either the first user's changes are saved permanently, or the second's). This is entirely unsatisfactory. I considered two possibilities to solve this problem:</p>

<p>The first is to lock the document when it is opened by someone the first time, and unlock it when it is closed. But if the network connection to the server is suddenly interrupted, the document would stay in a forever-locked state. The obvious solution is to send regular pings to the server. If the server doesn't receive K pings in a row (K > 1) from a particular client, documents locked by this client are unlocked. If that client re-appears, documents are locked again, if someone hadn't already locked them. This could also help if the client application (running in web browser) is terminated unexpectedly, making it impossible to send a 'quitting, unlock my documents' signal to the server.</p>

<p>The second is to store multiple versions of the same document saved by different users. If changes to the document are made in rapid succession, the system would offer either to merge versions or to select a preferred version. To optimize storage space, only document diffs should be kept (just like source control software).</p>

<p>What method should I choose, taking into consideration that the connection to the server might <em>sometimes</em> be slow and unresponsive? How should the parameters (ping interval, rapid succession interval) be determined?</p>

9702,"<p>As part of our current database work, we are looking at a dealing with the process of updating databases.</p>

<p>A point which has been brought up recurrently, is that of dealing with system vs. user values; in our project user and system vals are stored together. For example...</p>

<p>We have a list of templates.</p>

<pre><code>1, &lt;system template&gt;

2, &lt;system template&gt;

3, &lt;system template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These are mapped in the app to an enum (1, 2, 3)</p>

<p>Then a user comes in and adds...</p>

<pre><code>4, &lt;user template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>...and...</p>

<pre><code>5, &lt;user template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Then.. we issue an upgrade.. and insert as part of our upgrade scripts...</p>

<pre><code>&lt;new id&gt; [6], &lt;new system template&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>THEN!!... we find a bug in the new system template and need to update it... The problem is how? We cannot update record using ID6 (as we may have inserted it as 9, or 999, so we have to identify the record using some other mechanism)</p>

<p>So, we've come to two possible solutions for this.</p>

<h2><strong>In the red corner (speed)....</strong></h2>

<p>We simply start user Ids at 5000 (or some other value) and test data at 10000 (or some other value). This would allow us to make modifications to system values and test them up to the lower limit of the next ID range. </p>

<p>Advantage...Quick and easy to implement, </p>

<p>Disadvantage... could run out of values if we don't choose a big enough range!</p>

<h2><strong>In the blue corner (scalability)...</strong></h2>

<p>We store, system and user data separately, use GUIDs as Ids and merge the two lists using a view.</p>

<p>Advantage...Scalable..No limits w/regard to DB size. </p>

<p>Disadvantage.. More complicated to implement. (many to one updatable views etc.)</p>

9926,"<p>We have a codebase that is several years old, and all the original developers are long gone.  It uses many, many threads, but with no apparent design or common architectural principles.  Every developer had his own style of multithreaded programming, so some threads communicate with one another using queues, some lock data with mutexes, some lock with semaphores, some use operating-system IPC mechanisms for intra-process communications.  There is no design documentation, and comments are sparse.  It's a mess, and it seems that whenever we try to refactor the code or add new functionality, we introduce deadlocks or other problems.</p>

<p>So, does anyone know of any tools or techniques that would help to analyze and document all the interactions between threads?  FWIW, the codebase is C++ on Linux, but I'd be interested to hear about tools for other environments.</p>

<p>The problem is that you have one of your pages in a web application timing out when it gets to a stored procedure call, so you use Sql Profiler, or your application trace logs, to find the query and you paste it into management studio to figure our why it's running slow.

10006,"<p>I have a silverlight 2 beta 2 application that accesses a WCF web service.  Because of this, it currently can only use basicHttp binding.  The webservice will return fairly large amounts of XML data.  This seems fairly wasteful from a bandwidth usage standpoint as the response, if zipped, would be smaller by a factor of 5 (I actually pasted the response into a txt file and zipped it.).  </p>

<p>The request does have the ""Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"" - Is there any way have the WCF service gzip (or otherwise compress) the response?</p>

<p>I did find this <a href=""http://www.vistax64.com/indigo/113763-wcf-client-j2ee-server-using-gzip.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">link</a> but it sure seems a bit complex for functionality that should be handled out-of-the-box IMHO.</p>

<p>OK - at first I marked the solution using the System.IO.Compression as the answer as I could never ""seem"" to get the IIS7 dynamic compression to work.  Well, as it turns out:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Dynamic Compression on IIS7 <strong>was</strong> working al along.  It is just that Nikhil's Web Developer Helper plugin for IE did not show it working.  My guess is that since SL hands the web service call off to the browser, that the browser handles it ""under the covers"" and Nikhil's tool never sees the compressed response.  I was able to confirm this by using Fiddler which monitors traffic external to the browser application.  In fiddler, the response was, in fact, gzip compressed!!</p></li>
<li><p>The other problem with the System.IO.Compression solution is that System.IO.Compression does not exist in the Silverlight CLR.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So from my perspective, the EASIEST way to enable WCF compression in Silverlight is to enable Dynamic Compression in IIS7 and write no code at all.</p>",What is the easiest way to add compression to WCF in Silverlight?,What is the easiest way to add compression to WCF in Silverlight?
