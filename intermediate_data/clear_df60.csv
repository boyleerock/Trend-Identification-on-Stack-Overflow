From my (somewhat limited knowledge) of the ""under-the-hood"" working of a SQL Connection, many steps are involved, such as:
The Steps Under the Hood
Physical socket/pipe is opened (using given drivers, eg ODBC)
Handshake with SQL Server
Connection string/credentials negotiated
Transaction scoping
Not to mention connection pooling, i believe there is some kind of alogrithm involved (if the connection string matches one for an already existing pool, the connection is added to the pool, otherwise new one is created)
IDiposable
With regards to SQL Connections, we implement IDisposable so that when we call dispose (either via the using directive, or explicity), it places the connection back into the connection pool. This is in stark contrast with just the plain old sqlConnection.Close() - as all this does is close it temporarily, but reserves that connection for later use.
From my understanding, .Close() closes the connection to the database, whereas .Dispose() calls .Close(), and then releases unmanaged resources.
Those points in mind, at the very least it is good practice to implement IDisposable."

Some tools expect the Google XYZ notation (with tile [0,0] in the upper left corner).

Have a look at this:
I prepared a website which shows visually the difference and also explains the problem. Have a look at:

There is also a source code for how the tiles and all coordinates are calculated. It is part of the GDAL2Tiles which you mentioned above - which is a code I created some years back.
Your second question is was about MBTiles. The mbutil utility has a parameter ""--scheme tms"" which allows to create the MBTiles file from tiles rendered with gdal2tiles.py.
GDAL reads just the KAP file, where each represents a map in the sheet (in case there are insets).
BTW Do you know that there is http://www.maptiler.com/ which solves the problems mentioned above directly? You can just drag&amp;drop into the GUI or pass on the command line the KAP file as it is and choose whether you want tiles in directory or MBTiles and it will directly render the output.

the limit here is not the number of stars, the limit is density, i.e. the number of stars visible at the same time ... with text disabled, i can get up to 700 @ 30fps, on a Core2Duo, with quite a recent version of the debug player ...
i realized, flash player is not very good at clipping ... and that actually, using the most simple way, you spend a whole lot of time moving around objects, that are far from being visible ...
to really be able to optimize things, i chose to use MVC here ... not in the classic bloated way ... the idea is to handle the model, and if any elements are visible, create views for them ...
now the best aproach is to build up a spatial tree ... 
you have leaves, containing objects, and nodes containing leaves or nodes
if you add an object to a leaf and it surpases a certain size, you turn it into a node with nn leaves, redestributing its children between 
any object added to the background will be added to a grid, determined by the object's coordinates ... grids are created just-in-time, an start off as leaves
the big advantage of this is, that you can quickly isolate the visible nodes/leaves.
in each iteration, only the nodes/leaves which either turn visible, or are already visible (and may become invisible), are interesting. you need not do any updates in the rest of the tree. after finding all the visible objects, you create views for objects that turn visible, update the position of those that simply stay visible, and destroy views for objects that become invisible ...
this saves an awful lot of everything ... memory and computation power ...
if you try with a huge world size (100000), you will see, that you run out of RAM quickly, long before CPU does anything ... instantiating 500000 stars uses 700MB ram, with about 50 stars visible, running at 70 fps without any tremendous CPU usage ...
the engine is just a proof of concept ... and code looks awful ... the only feature i am currently proud about is, that it supports object to occupate a certain area, which is why an object can be part of several leafs ... i think, this is something i will remove though, because it should give me a great speed up ... you also see, it stalls a little, while adding stars, which happens, when leafs flip to nodes ...
i am quite sure, this is not the best way for a spatial subdivision tree, it's just that everything i found seemed kind of useless to me ... probably someone who studied (and understood) CS, can refine my approach ... :)
other than that, i used an object pool for the views, and Haxe, since it performs better ... a thing that probably is not so clever, is to move all the views individually, instead of putting them on one layer and moving that around ...
some people also render things into s manually, to gain performance, which seems to work quite well (just can't find the question right now) ... you should however consider using  instead of  ...
hope this helps ... ;)

Basically, a linearized PDF has a bunch of ""hints"" at the beginning of the file giving byte offsets to various relevant bits, particularly the byte range needed to display the first page (which is required to be at the front of the PDF).
Requests to read these byte ranges may be broken up into any number of HTTP requests (including ""one"").  It's not particularly odd that iframe &amp; object tags behave differently.  In one case, the PDF gets an entire window to itself, in the other it must share with HTML content: however thinly wrapped, it is wrapped.
Alternatively, one of the requests could be for the beginning of the PDF rather than the entire thing, again related to linearized PDFs (attempting to determine if the PDF is linearized, then reading the whole thing).
In either of the above cases, this is normal behavior.  OTOH, if it's requesting the entire PDF twice, that's A Bad Thing... quite possibly a bug in the PDF plugin."

These never change, so there is no reason to define them again each time you call your routine.
Personally, I do not like inserting values into SQL statements, like you have shown. Rather, try to use Parameters.
To use Parameters, you'll need to look into your database to see what type of columns  and  are. My guess is that they are both int values, but these could be GUID like values, requiring  type strings. If these are strings, you should write down what sizes the columns are defined as.
For example: Below, my  column is the  and the size is 50. An  for this column would be:
Since I did not know what type of data you use, I created an enumerated type to show how each method would be used. If you do not have access to the table's design, the last resort is ""AddWithValue"" (I personally hate that one, because it makes me look like I don't know what my database has inside).
To use this enumerated type, I modified the signature of your method to pass in that value:
Obviously, you will not need this, because you should know what technique you are going to be coding with.
I wasn't able to figure out what your  object was. Initially, I thought this was your , but that does not have an  method, so I just commented it out:
Speaking of ...
I combined your  instance with your  instance. Less code typically means fewer errors:
The , by default, is , so this line is unnecessary:
I moved most of your variable reading outside of the  routine, as none of that should ever cause an exception to be generated.
Also, I used the more targeted  instead of the general . The only thing that could fail in the block is something  related, and the  will give you better/more specific error messages than the general  object will.

  Floating point is an approximation...  
http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/newbie.html#faq-29.17  
  The reason floating point will surprise you is that float and double
  values are normally represented using a finite precision binary
  format. In other words, floating point numbers are not real numbers.
  For example, in your machine's floating point format it might be
  impossible to exactly represent the number 0.1. By way of analogy,
  it's impossible to exactly represent the number one third in decimal
  format (unless you use an infinite number of digits)....
  The message is that some floating point numbers cannot always be
  represented exactly, so comparisons don't always do what you'd like
  them to do. In other words, if the computer actually multiplies 10.0
  by 1.0/10.0, it might not exactly get 1.0 back.
How to compare floating point:
http://c-faq.com/fp/strangefp.html  
  ...some machines have more precision available in floating-point
  computation registers than in double values stored in memory, which
  can lead to floating-point inequalities when it would seem that two

There are many ways to define the isEqual() function, including:

8.0,2011-11-03 10:32:56.673000+00:00,"Short answer: no.
Long answer:
There is limited introspection available at compilation time, and you can for example (using function overload resolution) detects if a class B is an accessible base class of another class D.
However that's about it.
The Standard does not require full introspection, and notably:
you cannot list the (direct) base classes of a class
you cannot know whether a class has only one or several base classes
you cannot even know if a base class is the first base or not
And of course, there is the issue that the object layout is more or less unspecified, anyway (though C++11 adds the ability to distinguish between trivial layout and class with virtual methods if I remember correctly, which helps a bit here!)
Using Clang, and its AST inspection capabilities, I think you could write a dedicated checker, but this seems quite complicated, and is of course totally non-portable.
Therefore, despite your bold claim P.S. Please don't reply with ""why do you want to do this"" or ""this is against the standard"". I know what what all this for, and I have my reasons to do this., you will have to adapt your ways.
Of course, if we were given a broader picture of your usage of this class, we might be able to pool our brains together and help you figure a better solution.
How to implement a similar system ?
I would propose, first, a simple solution:
 is the owner class, non-copyable, non-convertible
 implements a proxy over an existing  (as long as  is convertible to ) and provide the conversions facilities.
We will use the fact that all pointers to be manipulated inherit from  (this is a crucial information!)
Code:
Now that we laid down the foundations, we can make our adaptive proxy. Because we will only manipulate everything through , we ensure the type-safety (and the meaningful-ness of our ) by checking conversions through  and  in the template constructors:
It might be tweaked according to your needs, for example you could remove the ability to Copy and Move the  class to avoid situation where it point to a no longer valid .
On the other hand, you could also enrich this using a / approach in order to be able to copy and move the wrapper and still guarantee the availability (but beware of memory leaks).
Note: it is intentional that  does not provide an  method, such a method cannot be used with a base class. Otherwise with both  and  deriving from , you could attach a  through a  even though the original  was a ...
Note: this is easy because of the common  base class! This is what gives us a common denominator ()."

Given that you suggest in comments elsewhere that the file doesn't show up in diffs or even , it sounds like you've added it to your gitignore (maybe unintentionally via a wildcard pattern). I know you said you didn't, but if it doesn't show up in the output of  as an untracked file, then it's untracked and ignored. To verify this, you can list all files ignored by .gitignore:
You can also list all untracked files, ignored or not:
(You seem to say that you're very sure the file is tracked - if it really were,  would show the committed contents of the file. I suspect, however, that that will instead tell ""fatal: Path 'path/to/file' does not exist in 'HEAD'"".)
Another way to verify that the file is untracked and ignored is simply to rename it, then see if  reports it as deleted; if it doesn't, it wasn't tracked.
Assuming this does list the file in question, you should examine the file in your work tree. You can see what version of the file the other branch has using , to compare. If you're satisfied that you don't need the version in your work tree, simply remove it. If you're worried you might need it, rename it or move it out of the directory. If you realize you do need it, you should figure out what ignore pattern is ignoring it, remove that, add it, and commit it.

Personally I generally favour the second approach or the fourth. It's a consistent change: when I want to catch an exception, I introduce a / block.

The alternative, IMHO, would be to ban the const on the declarations, but use it on the definition (but I think one compiler rejects this, even if it is legal).  Anyway, you're right that it doesn't apply here: there is no externally visible declaration, separate from the catch block."

It would be better if `CanConvert` only returned true when `objectType == List>`.  Also, you should implement `CanWrite` to return false if `WriteJson` isn't implemented.  `CanRead` returns true by default in the base JsonConverter, so you don't need to override that one."
