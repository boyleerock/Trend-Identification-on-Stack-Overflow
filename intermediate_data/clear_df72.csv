66404633,raspberrypi with Canon over network,"Been trying to solve this for a few days. This is one of my first questions so please try not to chew my head off. It's got alot of bone in it anyways.
I've got a Pi3 connected via USB to a Canon M100, works perfectly using gphoto. What I'm trying to do is get some live view - previewing going on over my network. Code I run on the Pi
gphoto2 --stdout --capture-movie | ffmpeg -i - -vcodec mjpeg -pix_fmt yuv420p -threads 0 -f v4l2 /dev/video0 | cvlc v4l2:///dev/video --sout '#transcode{vcodec=mjpeg,vb=800,acodec=none}:rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}'
Everything up until the 2nd pipe works...I can view the mjpeg fine locally on the pi using vlc. Maybe my understanding of how this is working is not thorough enough, but I've tried every combination of switches and commands I can think of to send this over the network. Essentially how can I broadcast v4l2:///dev/video0
Maybe pipe | to | isn't the correct approach? Not enough time?
On my windows machine (Windows 10) I open VLC, open the Pi's 192.168.0.20:8554/ and it is unable to open the MRL.
Any ideas or thoughts would be most appreciated...I'm not looking to have anyone solve this, just a pointer in the right direction would be amazing. Am I on the right track here?
Thanks!!!

66404617,How i can create private and public routes in NextJs?,"I'm studying Nextjs, I come from React and a lot seems to be the same but I was lost with the authentication and private routes.
I looked for a lot of codes on the internet, but either they broke, they didn't make sense to me, or they didn't explain my doubts correctly. My scenario is basically:
I have an application
This application has public and private routes
Users need to login to access private routes
Private routes have the same Navbar
My questions are:
How to create private routes using ReactContext.
How to share the same NavBar between pages (Without having to place the NavBar component on each screen)
How to correctly authenticate a user with my own code using preferably ReactContext
How to reset the routes after authentication (The user is unable to return to the login screen if he clicks the back button on the browser)
How to correctly save the JWT token so that it saves the user's session for longer so that he does not need to log in again
My code is working so far, but I'm sure it is horrible and completely flawed.
I have the following files:
_app.js (Root of the Nextjs project)
index.js (Login page)
privateRoute.js (File that verifies if the user is logged in and allows or not his access)
userContext.js (File that saves user information to be accessed by other components and pages)
NavContext.js (File that checks whether someone is logged in to render the NavBar or not)
_app.js
index.js
privateRoute.js
userContext.js
NavContext.js
In private files I export them this way
I hope I managed to explain it well, I know it's a lot, but I didn't find any content explaining how to create a private route in Nextjs or how to authenticate correctly without using the authentication templates found in the Next documentation.

What I'm trying to do: given one of the objects in this data structure, I want to add another object after it. For example, if given the name &quot;Woody&quot;, the object I'm inserting needs to go between Woody and Crystal.
I already have a method for recursively iterating through the data structure to find an object when given a name (names are unique in this scenario). I'm just looking for a way to modify the entire data structure when something is inserted at an arbitrary location inside one of the nested arrays.
The only way I've been able to think of was to flatten the entire data structure first using , then flatten the object I'm inserting, then inserting it into the string, then converting the string back to an object. The issue with that is that JSON.stringify can be very slow for large objects, and performance is a priority here.",,1,5,,2021-02-27 23:55:22.443000+00:00,,2021-02-28 00:01:09.700000+00:00,,,,,827452,,1,1,javascript,33

I know that I can do this:

Here's the code in question:
How do I pick out the scale factors and print them in their own vectors ( vector to be specific), and print the correct matrices (ie: with zeros in each pivot column) for each step?
For example, I have the following results with the system:
2x + 3y =8
-x + 2y -z = 0
3x + 2y = 9

I've read a bunch of open and closed questions on the benefits of Parquet over CSV (answered: What are the pros and cons of parquet format compared to other formats?), and RecordIO-protobuf in terms of file vs. pipe mode (e.g. unanswered What makes RecordIO attractive). However, I haven't seen any comparison between RecordIO-protobuf and Parquet.
Here's what I could gather from my research:
Parquet is a columnar format, but RecordIO-protobuf is used for serialization.
Not all SageMaker algorithms support Parquet. Most SageMaker algorithms work best in RecordIO-protobuf format. (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/cdf-training.html)
Other than above two differences what are the pros and cons of using Parquet vs. recordIO format? Moreover, searching for &quot;Parquet vs. RecordIO&quot; gave me zero Google results, which makes me think that I am comparing apples with oranges.

66404504,Send POST request to Shiny,"I've seen a number of people ask various versions of this question but I haven't found a clear answer.
I would like to send a POST request to an R Shiny application so that after the request is received the Shiny app can render the data from the body of the request. For instance, consider the use case where I wrote some sort of special  R function that someone would run locally on their laptop. Within that function would be a  request that would upload the data to the Shiny server, and then the user would have the browser pop open and see the UI showing their data analyzed on the server. In a sense it's kind of like a fancy version of an &quot;upload data&quot; button, but instead of them uploading data from within the Shiny UI they instead would have the upload done before the UI opens by the function request.
So the flow would be:
User runs  function
That function does a POST request to the Shiny server to send the data
The browser pops open for that user so they can see the results from Shiny analyzing it.
So far as I can tell Shiny can't accept a POST request in this fashion. In fact I'm not sure there is any way for Shiny to accept data besides through a UI. It's almost like I want to have both Plumber and Shiny running on the same machine (Plumber to accept the data POST request, Shiny to then render the resulting UI), but that feels like overengineering.
Am I missing something? Is there a way to have this flow work with Shiny accepting the POST request directly?",,0,1,,2021-02-27 23:39:23.247000+00:00,,2021-02-27 23:39:23.247000+00:00,,,,,3735161,,1,2,r|post|shiny|plumber,69

The problem with R is that there's no way for me to do this without running out of memory on my computer.  My problem with python is that everything I've looked at online has only shown me how to append more rows, not columns.

66404418,MSVC cannot return an object that can be copied but cannot be moved,"While fiddling around with copy elision I came across this strange behavior:
GCC and Clang accept this code and are able to use copy elision in both cases.
In  MSVC complains that it cannot return  because the move constructor of  is deleted. However, I would expect it to be able to fall back on the copy constructor. Is this a bug in MSVC or is this desired behavior (that I don't understand) and GCC / Clang are too permissive?
If I provide a move constructor, MSVC is able to elide the move when compiling as Release.
Interestingly MSVC is able to compile . As far as I understand this is due to the mandatory copy elision when the result of a constructor call is returned. However it feels counter-intuitive that I am only able to return  by-value if I manually copy it.
I know that this situation might not be relevant for practical use since copyable objects usually are also moveable, but I am interested in the underlying mechanics.

66404407,Fastest way to append nonzero numpy array elements to list,"I want to add all nonzero elements from a  array  to a list . Previous research suggests that for numpy arrays, using  is most efficient. (My own benchmark below actually suggests it can be slightly improved using ).
However, in my case I want my output to be a list, because I am combining many arrays for which I don't know the number of nonzero elements (so I can't effectively preallocate a numpy array for them). Hence, I was wondering whether there are some synergies that can be exploited to speed up the process. While my naive list comprehension approach is much slower than the pure numpy approach, I got some promising results combining list comprehension with .
Here's what I found so far:
Yielding the following results:
Not surprisingly,  outperforms all other methods. Among the rest, method 2 (using ) is the best. Am I missing any obvious alternative that exploits the fact that I am converting to a list afterwards? Can you think of anything to further speed up the process?
Edit 1:
Performance of :
Timings are on par with :
Edit 2:
Here's some benchmarking using Mad Physicist's suggestion to use  to construct a  array instead.
Concatenating  arrays yields indeed another significant speed-up, although it is not directly comparable since the output is a  array instead of a list. So it will depend on the precise use what will be best.
TLDR;
1/ using  is the fastest of all the indexing options
2/ using  instead of  speeds up things by a factor 1.3 - 1.5
3/ with the gains of 1/ and 2/ combined, the speed is on par with

These tables are created from a txt document that have a hierarchy determined by the lines.
This is an simple example of 2 tables that i have (REGA100 and REGA101), where REGA100 is the &quot;father&quot; and REGA101 is the &quot;son&quot;:

66404323,Problem / Question with VUE Frontend and PHP Backend / Api,"First of all sorry for my english, since its not my native language. Hope its clear enough.
We are developing a user system where the user, after login in, can do various things like joining events, changing his profile data, leave messages in a board so others users can read and answer to it, etc.
The idea is to have two different &quot;projects&quot;, one for the backend ( already almost done as a CRUD Api using PHP ) and the frontend with VUE JS.
Both projects will be hosted on the same server so once its deployed we wont have any CORS or related problems.
At the moment the backend uses PHP Session ( could spend time changing the auth system if realy needed ) to know the user is loged in. Been testing with postman and everything seems to work as intended.
My problem comes on how to handle user sessions, to know the user is loged in etc during the development. Once the project is done and deployed on the same server, there would be no problem on using PHP Session or using JWT / Cookies. But during development, I see no way of testing the frontend without building it before because the API will be either on the server deployed already or localy on xampp, both ways giving me a lot of troubles because:
PHP SESSION:
As the php session is domain exclusive, each request from the frontend to the backend, as long as they are not on the same server, will be taken as different sessions.
JWT:
JWT Could be a solution but only if storing the token on localstorage, sessionstorage or a cookie that is not httponly because if i want the backend to set a httponly cookie with the token that cookie wont be available while in development because of different servers, not letting me test the frontend properly without building it and either deploying it to the host or copying it to xampp.
About localstorage, sessionstorage or normal cookies, after reading a lot, i discarded them because of the security problems it can cause like XSS, CSRF, etc.
So summarizing, I would say the best idea would be to use the php session as both projects will be hosted together but I have no idea how I can test the frontend without having to build it and uploading it or moving the dist folder to xampp.
Thanks for your time and hope you can enlighten me",,0,7,,2021-02-27 23:10:26.160000+00:00,,2021-02-27 23:10:26.160000+00:00,,,,,15298255,,1,0,javascript|php|vue.js|session|jwt,16

The way how event triggers work is, when an event is emitted, a specific serverless function will be called.

My solutions are:
Validate the user from serverless functions (using the given session variables sent from Hasura).
Restrict the access to serverless functions (only Hasura API can access). Something like cors.

First it would make sense to show the block of code and explain it first so you can get some context on what I'm talking about.
In my   method, I have this block of code ...
So in my app I have two types of users, and I used some logic to instantiate the proper viewController. The issue is this, say I log in as a student, minimize the simulator window, and rerun the simulator, it shows the wrong vc, but when I do the same thing again it shows the correct vc. The same thing applies for the other user. Also another bug, say the user is logged out and the state listener is not active, but as soon as I log in as a school user, the vcs are switched again, but if I rerun the simulator it'll obviously show the right vc.
I also get this error in the console, I looked it up, but I couldn't take what I seen in other issues and apply it to mine.

66404259,Using Blendshapes as animationframes in Spark AR to animate Mesh Object,"I am trying to animate a 3D object in spark AR. For you to understand what I'm trying to do, I'll explain exactly what I did in blender, how I imported it in spark and what I did there. It's my first spark AR project and I'm not used to the reactive programming yet, so sorry if I made rookie mistakes there.
So let's go through it step by step:
First I created a sphere in blender and manipulated it's shape with a diplace modifier and a cloud texture. I animated the displacement by linking the texture coordinates to an empty object, that i keyframed so i get a looping deformation animation.
Then I converted the animation frames to keyframed shapekeys by exporting it from blender as an .mdd file, reimporting and applying it to the sphere object. So I have one shapekey for every frame of the animation in blender.
I exported the object as a .fbx File and imported it into spark AR studio. So far everything worked exactly as a hoped it would. I have the object in spark with all the attached shapekeys as blendshapes of the mesh object. I tested every single one of the blendshapes by setting all of them to 0 and then setting them to 100% seperately and they all work perfectly.
Screenshot of my spark Project with the mesh object selected and the blendshapes listed to the right
Now I figured I could recreate the loop animation that I did in blender by cycling through the blendshapes and setting them to 1 and back to 0 frame by frame. So here is what I tried in script:
Require the modules I need:
Load the assets from the spark project (in this case I only need the Meshobject, that I named Hoverball.001):
Then I called a function and give it the assets I loaded in the promise as a parameter. I assign the loaded meshobject to a variable and use the getBlendShapes()-Method to get an array filled with all the Blendshapes in the Meshobject.
Then I create a Loop Animation with a frame transition by using a timeDriver and a frame-sampler, starting the timedriver right away and combining both the driver and the sampler in an animation.
Now a assign the frameAnimation to a variable to get the current Frame of the Loop animation. (This step might be a bit useless, but I wanted to have a variable that helps me understand what I'm dealing with). So now I have the current Frame as a scalarSignal in my currentFrame Variable and I use that variable to access the weight Property of the Blendshape corresponding to the current frame of the animation, change it to 1 and at the same time setting the weight of the Blendshape corresponding to the previous frame to 0. Obviously the first frame works a bit different then the rest, because I have to set the last frame (in this cas frame 239) to 0. To achieve that, I check if the current frame is 0. I could get the index if the last frame from the frame count that I set in the sampler, but I didn't want to overcomplicate things, so I just hard coded the 239 in here.
I did a bunch of console logs there to see whats happening and the script does pretty much what I wanted. It accesses the Blendshapes weight and changes it to 1, changing the shape of the meshobject in the viewport. However, it does not loop or cycle through all the blendshapes. It just does the first frame and then stops. When I set the start frame to like 200 or something, it just does it once for frame 200. Basically, my code works fine, the frame 200 Blendshape is even set to 1 and the shape changes to the Blendshape but I just can't figure out how I get my script to do the weight change for every frame and not just once for the first frame it gets and then stop doing anything at all. Maybe I'm going at this all wrong and there's an easier way to loop through the blendshapes, but I thought my approach was pretty straightforward and there's so little missing for it to work. So, if anyone has an Idea how to make it work, please help :)",,0,0,,2021-02-27 23:00:07.593000+00:00,,2021-02-27 23:00:07.593000+00:00,,,,,15298108,,1,0,javascript|animation|augmented-reality|spark-ar-studio,6

I have found discussions from various languages/frameworks, and the general consensus has been that authentication is better handled outside of GraphQL. While I appreciate this suggestions, and will probably end up going down that path, I still see this as an interesting problem as it pushes the boundaries of referential transparency and it is quite difficult to get the types right.
I have attempted something like the following but the types don't align, and there is also the separate question where that  lives...

As we all know, when we store a date in mongodb it automatically converts the date of our time zone to UTC by changing the time but keeping the same absolute value below.
The problem I have is that when I query the database to get the date using pymongo I get exactly the same date and time that is stored in mongodb in UTC but in my time zone without having made the conversion change;
for example, Let's suppose I create a datetime in python using the &quot;datetime&quot; library:
and I get this date in my time zone:
look at -05:00 at the end
when I save that date in my mongodb collection in atlas, it transforms the date to UTC which looks like this:
look at +00:00 at the end
So far so good, the problem comes when I query the database to obtain that same date using pymongo method &quot;find_one&quot;
what i get is this:
look at -05:00 at the end
the same time and date as UTC but in my time zone, which in theory should not happen, I should get the date in UTC or in the local time zone but with the change. That bug can be critical in the system I'm developing.
Does anyone know what could be happening, if it is some kind of bug in the current versions?
I am using python 3.8.5, pymongo 3.11.3 and mongodb 4.4.4

Then when I go into Play Mode, the frames have dropped from 350 to 40. Unbelievable. Really just takes all the wind out of me, the game has like 10 objects, none of them are moving, the only script that is running is the movement script, there are no errors in the compiler, and if I remove the UI canvas the game runs at a steady 350 frames again.

66404049,"Javascript ""NaN"" in an IF Statement","this is a beginner JS question regarding NaN in an IF statement. I have code below that prompts user to enter a number, and the program will generates a random number between 1 and the user's input. However, IF the user doesn't enter a number, it will prompt user to retry and enter a valid number instead.
The question I have is the userNumber section of the IF statement. The condition is basically asking IF userNumber IS a number, then output the random number. But why is it simply written with the variable in the condition, and not a condition such as if (userNumber != NaN) or if (userNumber == number)? Why is it just the variable in the condition?
To me, reading that line of code I'm thinking: &quot;... if userNumber WHAT? There's nothing after userNumber, so what is the condition?&quot;",,4,2,,2021-02-27 22:30:14.713000+00:00,,2021-02-28 05:21:09.250000+00:00,,,,,7188156,,1,0,javascript,37

66404046,Selenium Scrapers colliding - how to align them?,"I have configured a web scraper, that scrapes a website for live soccer matches being played.
The scraper runs every 20 minutes through a cron and takes about 1-2min to scrape each game. Once a game is scraped, its game link is added to a &quot;blacklist&quot; JSON file so it does not get scraped again.
This works fine at times when there are only few games going on simultaneously.
On days like Saturday or Sunday there may be so many games simultaneously, that the program cannot catch up anymore and scraping the games takes longer than 20 minutes so that already a new browser opens before the other session has concluded.
Eventually that leads to 7+ browsers being open, some of them even scraping the same game, and the whole thing crashing..
How can I structure this better, so that this cannot occur?
Setting the cronjob to less frequently than every 20m is not an option, I would actually like to set it more frequently to every 5m.

66404044,How to Prevent Terraform From Replacing ECS Service with CodeDeploy,"Original
I'm using AWS CodeDeploy to update an ECS Service. During a CodeDeploy deployment, it will change the target group from how it's configured in Terraform. This creates a problem because Terraform will then overwrite the current load balancer and cause the service to be temporarily unavailable.
How can I tell Terraform to avoid changing the target group? I've tried using a  block  but then Terraform fails to apply because it looks like there's no load balancer at all.
Maybe a better question would be, how can I manage Terraform updates and CodeDeploy in the same application?
Here's what the change to Terraform looks like after a CodeDeploy.

Situation: I have 2 datasets that I am joining together using Merge query. I need to see if a user from a table of external data matches a user in my company, so I can import the external data to the correct user's file and associate it with their ID number.
Goal: I want to reduce the number of files where I have to go hunting to try to match the person, contact the external company, etc. The data in the external dataset is messy because it is user entered.
What I have done: I created primary key columns for both tables with the first 3 letters of last name, first 3 of the first name + birth date (uppercased, trimmed, stripped of accents).  This gives a successful match for most cases. But there are always people who used their middle name or switched their month and day of birth.  Some of these records will match based on the email.
What this is not: I know that I can highlight multiple columns when mergeing, but that essentially uses something like DOEJOH1990-11-01JOHNDOE@EMAIL.COM for the match, which would give fewer match results since more elements could be mis-entered.

slow.js
Execution
The difference between the codes is line 6.
But these parts never run because it's dead code.
@tkihira analyzed and concluded that variable  was allocated in heap because it's used in closure when slow.js ran so that it took more time to increment it in the for loop. While  in fast.js is in a register.
This made the speed difference.
Does anyone know which part of the code in V8 makes this behavior?
Is it true that a number variable is allocated in heap when it's used in a closure that never runs and a variable and it's in a register when it's not used in a closure?

66403830,React hook use class object as useState,"A bit new to React here.
While developing a personal project based on React, I often came up against scenarios where I needed child components to update state passed down to it by a parent, and have the updated state available in both child and parent components.
I know React preaches a top-down flow of immutable data only, but is there an elegant way of solving this issue?
The way I came up with is as shown below. It gets the job done, but it looks and feels ugly, bloated, and it makes me think I'm missing something obvious here that a well-established framework like React would've definitely accounted for in a more intuitive way.
As a simple example, assume that I have a couple of nested components:
And that I need each child component to be able to modify the state such that it is also accessible to its parent component as well. A use case might be that you could interact with the  component to edit a comment, and then interact with a  button defined in the  component to save the entire state to a database or something like that.
The way I presently handle such scenarios is this:
When you change the , it calls the  handler, which in turn calls the  handler, which finally calls the  handler. This finally updates the state, causing a re-render and propagates the updated state all the way back down.
It gets the job done. But it is ugly, bloated, and looks very wrong in the sense that the  component has an unrelated  method, the  component has an unrelated  method, and the  component has an unrelated  method.
Is there a better way to solve this?
Additionally, when the state finally changes, all components that rely on this state are re-rendered whether they directly use the  property or not, as the entire object reference has changed.
I came across  library which looks awesome. However, I found that this doesn't work when the state is an instance of a class with methods. The proxied object has methods but without  reference bound properly. I would love to hear someone's solution to this as well.

66403791,What is a good use of the intermediate hidden states of an RNN?,"So I've used RNN/LSTMs in three different capacities:
Many to many: Use every output of the final layer to predict the next. Could be classification or regression.
Many to one: Use the final hidden state to perform regression or classification.
One to many: Take a latent space vector, perhaps the final hidden state of an LSTM encoder and use it to generate a sequence (I've done this in the form of an autoencoder).
In none of these cases do I use the intermediate hidden states to generate my final output. Only the last layer outputs in case #1 and only the last layer hidden state in case #2 and #3. However, PyTorch  returns a vector containing the final hidden state of every layer, so I assume they have some uses.

The Group component sends its ID to the Customer Finder Component in order to get the customers from that Group.
The scenario that I currently have is:
The Group Component have a button called &quot;Search Customers&quot;.
The button opens a modal with the Customer Finder component (basically an input to search and a list with all customers that match with the search term.
The user clicks on any customer (e.g: Customer 1, Customer 2, Customer 3). Any selected customers is marked with a check icon and also, the background color changes. Then clicks on &quot;Save&quot; button inside the modal to confirm. Once that button is clicked, emits an array to the parent component with those 3 clients.
Then the user clicks on &quot;Save Group&quot; button inside the Group component to do a API call to store the information (the Group component have: name, description, public/private, customers, etc).
The issue that I currently have is, when I do the process above and then open the modal again, the selected customers are not retained (with the styles, but the records are in the database), so I was thinking that maybe I need to &quot;reload&quot; or &quot;refresh&quot; (execute again the onInit maybe) the Customer Finder Component so it can have the new data related with customers.

66403741,Finding an object with smallest attribute value in vector container,"So I have seen quite a few posts explaining how to use min_element(vector.begin(), vector.end()); to find the smallest element in a vector container of integers.
What I have is a vector container of objects, and I need to find the object in the vector container with the smallest value for its float estTotalCost; attribute. So min_element() is not going to help me here since I'm assuming it would be trying to compare entire objects to each other and I want to compare only one attribute of each object.
So my question is, what is the most efficient way for me to accomplish this task? Is there an existing C++ function that can do this well for me? If not can somebody recommend an efficient function that would perform this operation quickly.
This is going to be used to find the next node in an open list for an A* pathfinding algorithm that I'm writing myself so it is important that the operation be efficient.
Thank you in advance!
The post that mine has been flagged as a duplicate of does not answer my question. That post discusses using the find() function to find a specific object within a vector container. I want to compare the estTotalCost attribute of every object in the vector container and return the one with the smallest value for its estTotalCost attribute.

66403719,How to handle streaming data with server intensive computation,"I want to be able to upload a huge file (several gigabytes) of 300 dimensional datapoints via the browser.
This browser will then forward (using websockets) these points to a server, which projects the points to a lower dimension.
Since I can't have the entire dataset in memory at any given time, I use PapaParse to read the file in one by one in the browser. However, right now, it is sending the data faster than the server can process, which causes the TCP buffer to fill up. Because of this, it takes far longer to get the projections of the first 10.000 points when I upload a 30 mb file (3s), compared to when I upload a 2gb file (20s).
In other words, the total time to receive all the points back is longer than O(#points), which I would like to have.
Should I try slowing down the sending rate on the side of the browser? This doesn't sound like a good idea, since the optimal rate depends on the current load of the server.

66403651,"MagpieRSS RSS Parser worked in PHP 5.6, not working in PHP 7.0. Looking for new solution","A few days ago, my web hosting service (GoDaddy) switched me from PHP 5.6 to PHP 7.3. My web application where I used MagpieRSS was working perfectly in 5.6 but completely fails in 7.3. I was using MagpieRSS for parsing data from an Atom/xml feed file. The link for the file is:
https://alerts.weather.gov/cap/oh.php?x=0
This is a feed that is put out by the National Weather Service for providing weather alert information. This feed uses a Common Alert Protocol (CAP) alert messaging.
Since the failure, I have been searching through stackoverflow for a simpler method to pull the data from the above page. I have tried using simplexml_file_load(), cURL examples, other examples found on stackoverflow, and other sites to try to pull this feed. Nothing has worked and I get mostly load failures, 'page not working' errors, etc. A simple example that I have tried includes:
All I get are blank screens. This has been the case for almost every example I have tried. I'm not an expert on this but have run out of ideas. I should mention that my php.ini looks as follows:
I'm looking for any suggestions that would help me to at least be able to ensure that I am pulling this feed. I know how to parse the xml data including the cap:xxx details. Once I have the file in an array object, I can do the rest.
If there is a newer xml/Atom parser out there that works in PHP 7.3, I'm willing to try it. If someone could provide advice or guidance on how to pull the file directly without someone else's parser code, I'd like to learn how to do it. If you have an example that will work, please share it with me.

66403647,Publish stored procedure from SQL Server Project selectively depending on the server,"I have an SQL Server Project as a part of my solution in Visual Studio. It requires that I include some stored procedures that access a different database on the same server. This database is not under our control, nor is it accessible locally to the developers, or in our dev Server. And we cannot import that database because its a few TB in size. The functionality represented by this stored procedures does not need to be called in our dev environment, and only has testable data in the staging and production environments where the other database is accessible.
When we attempt to publish the project to our dev servers, or locally, the publish script generated by VS fails at run time because SQL Server can't generate a stored procedure if it can't resolve the references to the missing database.
I am looking for a way to setup the publishing so that it is selective based on the @@servername variable (ideally, but I am open to other realistic scenarios, such as a way to tell the SQL Server not to try to resolve those references)
Thanks
P.S. I hadnt thought of mentioning it until @larnu's comment, but an additional thorn here is that our dev environment is hosted as an Azure Web app and using an Azure SQL Database server.

66403623,Can a node in a cluster managed by Kubernetes discover its healthy peers?,"(I am a kubernetes novice, and my company uses kubernetes to manage our microservice architecture. We use ASP.NET and C#)
I have a cluster of identical service instances, which have some state and do long-running work. Each instance is always available to receive a request to the cluster, but I would like the work for the request to be handled by whichever node within the cluster which is the least-loaded. (i.e. I want the receiving node to forward the request to the most free node.)
My services provide an api to query for their current load. &quot;Load&quot; in my scenario is not measurable by simple cpu/memory usage, so a typical load balancer doesn't help here. However, since service instances may randomly become unhealthy, and I may scale up or down the cluster, the set of &quot;currently healthy nodes&quot; is dynamic and cannot be injected via config at deploy time.
Does Kubernetes expose an api that my service could query to get back the set of instances that are healthy/available? If so, I could easily discover my healthy nodes, and then ping them for their load, in order to decide who to forward to.",,0,1,,2021-02-27 21:25:44.070000+00:00,,2021-02-27 21:25:44.070000+00:00,,,,,1596160,,1,0,.net|kubernetes|microservices|load-balancing|peer,12

Would it be possible to hand-roll an in-app browser like Capacitor/ Cordova/ some other IAB to support the W3C Web Speech API specification?
Would it even be allowed? Would Apple allow an app with such an IAB in their app store?

The query returns data as expected and I can loop over it creating a new myClass for each recordset and then adding the values into the arrays, I can also access each property through console.log.
What I can't do is send the object as whole to console, it prints as {myClass {}}.

When executed I get:
So  threw an r-value (pr-value) but why the catch in  with plain l-value reference is executed?

66403497,Is there a way to use switch on an array that includes wildcards in swift?,"I want to do this:
But I get this error: &quot;'_' can only appear in a pattern or on the left side of an assignment&quot;
I searched around on this error message and &quot;wildcards swift array switch statements&quot; and it seems like it is not possible to use wildcards in this context, but there may be some sort of workaround using 'operator overloading' with something involving ~=.  However, this is way over my current knowledge, I haven't found a case example exactly like mine, and there seems to be a fair amount of implied concern that operator overloading is bad for some reason.  Also, the examples I've found that are sort of like my case look very convoluted.  I'm an self-taught amateur just trying to hack together a basic app to make my work life easier, so apologies for any stupid questions but I'd like to better understand the following:
Why can't I use wildcards in this context?  It seems like they work with tuples but not arrays for some reason, and I don't get why one would work but not the other.
Is operating overloading actually 'bad' and is there a relatively straightforward way to implement this functionality?
If not- can someone recommend an alternate approach?  I chose this approach because I have two arrays, one for a series of questions, one to record responses to each question.  I want to implement pretty complicated logic where the configuration of responses to prior questions will determine which question is presented next (example below).  I wasted a bunch of time drowning in convoluted 'if' statements before realizing I needed a cleaner approach and this seemed to be it.  However, without wildcards or something similar it would not be practical to explicitly define every case.  Could someone recommend a different approach in this situation?  Obviously this is a streamlined example and there would be many more defined cases.

66403481,Setting up AWS ELB with backend express app,"I have a web project I am building for fun.  It is react, express, mongodb
I currently have an aws domain we will call foo.com that my react app is linked to.  I am using S3 and cloudfront to route foo.com as my react app sitting in S3.
I created an SSL cert for foo.com.
That all works
Now on an EC2 instance I have a Express.js app that I am using as a rest server.  So my react app uses my elastic ip to call using REST on my EC2 instance.
Since I added SSL to my react app it now will not allow non SSL calls into my api so I am trying to fix that.
I setup an ELB and used my foo.com cert (Mistake?) pointing at my EC2 and opened port 80 and 443  via security group, all works. Except my cert is for foo.com. and my backend server is just setup to use elastic up.  Or I guess now the load balancer URL. So I get an invalid certificate name error if I try to load the URL to my express app via the load balancer URL.
How do I use SSL to have my react app make http calls to my express backend.  Do I create a new cert?  The cert seems to want a DNS name like foo.com but my backend server is just an elastic ip.
Not really sure how to tie all this together I think I am 90% where I need to be.?

Maybe I'm not using the correct terms but I will explain what I need with an example.
Having the condition:
Let's suppose the condition is met and printing the message  as should, but later the next new condition is met (important, after the 1st condition is met):
What I need is when the second condition is met then the first message  doesn't be displayed anymore even if the  again, so I need that  be permanent &quot;skipped&quot;, permanent &quot;disabled&quot; or the correct way it calls, and now in substitution of , then the new and permanent displayed message be . So as you can see, in the situation I describe  has more weight than  because once  then the permanent message to be displayed is  (&quot;forever&quot;).
For a while I have been using some different combinations of  + , and  + , and  + and extra separated , but no positive results for now, because yes, I get the  message displayed once the 2nd condition is met but for a strange reason what the code does is once the 2nd condition is met it displays both message on screen  and , both at the same time and I don't understand why it could be happening because both conditions are mutually exclusive, so in theory, when once one of them is met what I think is the other is automatically &quot;disabled&quot;. I don't know if the fact about both conditions are into a loop makes any special case because this is happening.

It finds size (k) of characters between delimiters -&gt; malloc memory -&gt; copy from string to malloc -&gt; copy from malloc to malloc -&gt;start over.
But well... function shows segmentation fault. Debugger shows that after allocating &quot;big&quot; memory it does not go inside while loop, but straight to big[y][z] = small[z] after what it exits the function.
Any tips appreciated.",,1,14,,2021-02-27 21:01:22.503000+00:00,,2021-02-27 22:20:44.363000+00:00,2021-02-27 22:20:44.363000+00:00,,898348.0,,15171600,,1,0,c|multidimensional-array|malloc|delimiter,56

66403439,user indexing for something similar to a matrix,"Need to start off by saying that this is essentially a homework question and itâs really a tough one for me.
From the print output of a dynamic matrix (or anything that can be formatted and printed to be visually similar), I need to use indexing from a userâs input to change values in that âmatrixâ. It doesn't have to be a matrix, something that can be formatted to be similar would also work.
What makes this problem hard for me is that only un-nested lists, strings, or dictionaries can be used, and importing packages is not allowed. So, list comprehension is out of the question.
One thing Iâve tried so far is to print separate lists and index based on separate lists but I got stuck. Another method I tried was to dynamically populate a dictionary with keys starting with âR1C1â (Row 1, Column 1) based on user input but I donât know how to proceed from here either.",66403542.0,1,1,,2021-02-27 21:00:45.490000+00:00,,2021-02-27 22:10:53.800000+00:00,2021-02-27 22:10:53.800000+00:00,,14026994.0,,14026994,,1,0,python|matrix,24

66403365,react-native-push-notification custom sound not working when android app is killed,"UPDATE I found a fix!! I am testing it and will publish the solution ASAP
I have been working on adding custom sounds to push notifications for a react-native app using  version  and  version .
The reason why I haven't upgraded to the latest version of  is because custom sounds do not seem to work even with proper channel configuration. We are also using expo, which appears to be causing a startup error when using version 7+.
I have two mp3 files called  and . The firebase functions that send the push notifications sends the message using the common data object, but also platform-specific fields for push notification sounds:
From my understanding, the  field under  does contain the payload that will be added to the root-level  object when the app is killed and receive the notification. The plugin's source also seem to be using that exact  field to set the notification sound (in RNReceivedMessageHandler.java):
Here is what I got so far:
custom sound works great when the app is in foreground
custom sound work great when app is in background
default sound plays when app is killed
Here is the code currently in place to manage the notifications:
In index.ts:
In App.js
I was wondering if anyone else had an idea about what could be going on. The notification still manage to get to my device even when the app is killed, which is great. The only missing part is the sound.

I have a macro that create a new sheet and feed some data (in this new sheet) that came from home sheet that users will input data, besides some formulas that I create in VBA that will feed that new sheet too. Ok, so, after that, I have to use Offset + Match to create a variable (works fine in Excel) --I called &quot;ParcelaHoje&quot;-- that return a value based on a cell value right on the side. Them problem is that the two variables that I use in Match function is different. One of them is Date (&quot;MesAtual&quot;) and the another is a Range, I think. I'm kind of confused with what type of variable will be a variable that contains dates in each cell. An array I suppose.
I've tried to use Application.Match instead of WorksheetFunction.Match, the return error is diferent, but still an error. That's not where the problem is, I think.
I've tried to declare a variable that contains that Range(&quot;B:B&quot;), but not working too.

My scenario is given below.
I have a big team that is following a longer sprint length (1-month sprint cadence for example)) and a sub-team that is trying 1-week sprints.

1. Mount a host directory as data volume:
The first option is to mount a directory on your host as a data volume in your container. To do that, use the docker run command with the -v :/var/opt/mssql flag. This allows the data to be restored between container executions.
2. Use data volume containers:
The second option is to use a data volume container. You can create a data volume container by specifying a volume name instead of a host directory with the -v parameter. The following example creates a shared data volume named sqlvolume.

The data is an array of  objects and I use a popup triggered in the table to edit data for a resource with hopes that the changes will be reflected in react-table. The initial data is populating but changes are not being reflected in my table. After saving changes to the database, I am calling SWR's  function in  to update the client side data and expecting the changes to be reflected in react-table but React doesn't seem to recognize the changes to the  array.
Note that I have confirmed the mutation is running correctly via console.log statements and the  array is reflecting the changes in the console.
The Question: If I add an object to the  array, a rerender is triggered, but if I just update an object in the array no rerender is triggered. (In both cases, I am first spreading the existing array to create new array.) Why isn't React (or SWR?) recognizing that  array changed when I just change an object in the  array?
You'll see in the code below that I added a  function that logs when  changes. It logs on page load when  is empty, logs again when  is populated with initial data from SWR, and logs again if I add/remove items in the  array via the  function (see &quot;for testing&quot; comment in code below). It does NOT log when just updating a resource object in the array (after spreading it). Why not?!

It is a cross-field validation confirm password validator so it is just checking that these 2 fields are the same.
Currently I am declaring and using the validator like this:
When I do it this way and then debug it seems that the validator only fires when the page is loading after clicking refresh but if I type into the fields it does not fire. So here the div containing &quot;Passwords do not match {{registerForm.get('confirmPassword')!.errors | json}}&quot; never is displayed.
I thought maybe this could be because the validator should be set on the form control in the component code instead of the form group and so I tried changing it to include this in the form group creation:
And that did cause validator to fire at the expected time but I don't seem to have access to the correct form controls inside of the validator.
The calls to  and  return null and when I try to access the parent by changing it to  the parent is null and this causes an error.
So I need to either be able to either:
Get the validator to fire correctly when set on the form group
Access both form controls when setting the validator on the form control

The dependencies are minimal (just Ruby stdlib). Here are options I've considered and opted against:
rubygems: I'm not a huge fan of using a language's package manager for end-user software. What happens when the system upgrades its version of Ruby? Does the user have a ruby version manager like rvm or rbenv installed? and so on.
Docker: a couple weeks back, an article entitled Run More Stuff in Docker was trending on HN. I like the idea, but the approach is a minor hobby unto itself and way too burdensome to ask of general-audience, potentially not-very-technical end-users.

66403067,Spring WebClient and shared client credential token for all requests,"I tried to use Spring WebClient and Spring Security OAuth2 Client for communication between two applications. I need to use OAuth2 Client Credentials grant type and use the same credentials and the same token for all requests between these applications. In the OAuth2 terminology resource owner is an application A itself and resource server is an application B (it is Keycloak Admin API). I use Spring Boot auto configuration from application.yaml and servlet environment. So I implemented it like this:
I found that I have an issue and invalid tokens (I use Keycloak and if my Keycloak is restarted then all old tokens are invalid) are never removed (you can see it in issue #9477) so I started debuging whole process of authorization in . I found that tokens are saved per user of the application A. It means that every user of the application A has its own token for authorization to the application B. But this is not my intended behavior I want to use only one token in the application A for consuming a resource from the application B.
I think that I found two solutions but both of them are not optimal.
Solution 1.:
Add another default request after  which replaces user  in attributes by an application . Problem is that it dependes on an  internal implemention of  which use a private attribute .
Solution 2.:
Use a custom implementation of  instead of default  (which I have to do anyway because of the issue with removing invalid tokens) where I ignore user's  and I use a custom application .

66403061,Pregel API - why iterations on small graph are consuming so much memory?,"I'm relatively new to Spark and Scala however I've decided to post here an example of code that is quite simple and in my perception shouldn't cause a serious problem, however in practice it cause Out of Memory error quite often in AWS EMR Spark environment depending on the value of  :
I run it in AWS EMR on 4 node m5.x2large cluster via Zeppelin, however it can be quickly adopted and executed as a job in spark.
In short this code creates a  graph with 4 vertices and 3 edges. then for each triplet I calculate some constants value and use graph object  for this.
Then for  I apply pregel API which execution is only limited by number of iterations . And at this moment for Pregel API I see strange behavior. For small  values (less than 10) it works quite fast, for 100-150 iterations it is performing for 3-4minutes in zeppelin, and for 200 iterations it fails with different errors (ConnectionClosed etc).
I tried to monitor what's going on with the cluster once I put maxIterations= 150 or 200 and it looks like this  Allocated memory goes straight up and available memory is decreasing at the same pace.
As I'm quite new to Spark I'm not sure this is correct behavior and quite honestly, I can't find an explanation of what could consume gigabytes of memory even with 200 iterations of pregel on such a small graph. If you can reproduce it on your end and check, I'm curios to listen to your advice on performance optimization, because if I expand the cluster and run the same code on a larger hardware setup, it simply just a question of  and size of graph to actually get same OutOfMemory error. And real graph I need to run this on is more than 1M vertices and ~7M edges so I can't figure out what kind of hardware it might require if this problem won't be solved.",,0,0,,2021-02-27 20:09:52.450000+00:00,,2021-02-27 20:09:52.450000+00:00,,,,,12501772,,1,1,apache-spark|amazon-emr|spark-graphx,10

The only thing that seems to work is to replace the double quotes with an empty string, like so:
However, this just feels wrong to me.  It works in this case given that paths cannot have double quotes, i.e., the double quote character is an illegal path variable.  But what if the returned registry value legitimately had a double quote in the string?  This brute approach would remove that double quote.

Basically, after I log into the website and select what kind of data I would like to retrieve, I am faced with a screen with several buttons, one of them being an Excel button to download the data in excel format. When I click on the Excel button, a pop up comes over the page as per the attached picture. This pop up is fixed on the screen (I cannot move it, but if I click outside of it, it disappears and leaves me with the webpage prior to clicking the Excel button). From that pop-up window, under the pulldown menu &quot;For which companies?&quot; I need to select &quot;A range of companies&quot; What I then need to do is to delete the text under the &quot;Name:&quot; field and enter a different name, e.g. name 1. And then in the &quot;from&quot; field, I need to enter 1 and in the &quot;to&quot; field, I need to enter 47619. Then I need to click on the &quot;Export&quot; button. On clicking the &quot;Export&quot; button, this instructs the database to download the data for these 47619 companies in the background. Then I repeat the process, i.e. Name: name2, from: 47620, to: 95238, Export, and so on. My downloads are in increments of 47619 observations and my name patterns will be name1,name2,name3....name117. This is the reason I am seeking to automate the above in a loop that follows the above naming structure and index counter increment of 47619 for each data download.
Once I finish, I will repeat all of the above 200 times (i.e. 200 x 117) so you can understand my interest in automating this.

What I have done so far is to find the co-ordinates to that Excel clickable button and get pyautogui to click on that button - that worked fine. What I don't know how to do now is once the pop-up window comes up, to fill in the fields as well as pull the drop-down menu and make a selection there). I searched the coordinates for say the &quot;Name:&quot; field and wanted to type into it but it is not responding. Please see what I have written so far (very basic) but I am not clear how to proceed. Someone suggested locateonscreen, I looked into that and tried to match a cut out picture from printscreen on the window, but I was not successful with that. I would very much welcome any ideas on this please and thank you in advance for your insights on this.

66403000,How to get data from elastic using the Collpase method in fluent in C#?,"I'm hoping to find the answer to this. I have a C# application that bulk downloads elastic data according to user parameters. Some of the requests can be for all data that don't require parameters. In elastic I have an index that contains signals for DOT, each signal is a document. These are updated on certain days, so a signal can have multiple documents in the index based on time stamp.
What I would like to accomplish is to bring back all signals based on their latest time stamps, so essentially it would be one document per signal, the document with the latest time stamp. In kibana, I was able to accomplish this using the &quot;collapse&quot; method with &quot;inner_hits&quot; in order to bring back the latest document by time stamp for each signal. Here is that kibana code:
In kibana, this does exactly what I want to do, bring back the latest signal documents by their time stamps.
When I entered the fluent code in C# and ran the application, I would get &quot;0 documents found&quot;. Here is the code in C#:
If I commented out the Collapse code and uncommented the Match All line above it, I would indeed get all documents, but that means all documents including all the ones per signal for all the differing times, which isn't what I want, I want only one document, the latest by time stamp, for each signal.
Why does the collapse code not bring back the documents I want in the order I specified? Is there something I'm missing, or is the C# code incorrect? If collapse won't work in C#, is there another way to retrieve the documents in the way I described? I was somewhat surprised to find so little information or documentation in the elastic site regarding the collapse method in fluent; believe me, I looked!

Assume that I can measure the level of healthiness by composite health score (CHS). Also, assuming the age is negatively (and linearly) associated with CHS, which means a 1-unit increase in age leads to a 1-unit decrease in CHS.
However, at age of 65, people can start using Medicare, the rate of CHS change may decrease after age 65(-0.5-unit decrease).
I want to look at the data between age 55 and 75, and see that the mean CHS of age 55 is 50, so I found a similar research provided the formula like this:
E(Yij) = Î²0 + Î²1uninsuredi + Î²2ageij + Î²3uninsuredi Ã ageij + Î²4(number of years older than 65 yearsij) + Î²5uninsuredi Ã (number of years older than 65 yearsij),
where Yij = health score for the ith individual at the jth survey, uninsured = 1 if uninsured prior to age 65 years and 0 if insured, age = (age in years) â 65 = centered age ranging from â10 to +8, and (number of years older than 65 years) = centered age if centered age &gt;0 and 0 if centered age â¤0.

66402891,Multiple optional query parameter in DynamoDB,"I'm trying to move from SQL Server to DynamoDB and I'm having trouble with queries that have multiple optional  parameters.
My SaaS application has ~30 customers. Each customer has around ~20k orders in the orders table and this keeps growing.
In the web application my customers can filter the orders very granular. This happens server based (DB based) via T-SQL.
In SQL my current solution looks like this:
The customer is able to filter a specific order by multimple optional parameters. So with that you could query down orders between two different creation and due date ranges with a specific order type that have been created by a specific user and are assigned to a specific dealer.
Sometimes they just want all open orders of a specific type for a specific dealer.
My PK in DynamoDB ist like customer#83F8B46E-5FD9-4E04-AEB5-73F1AF7182F2
I know that I should avoid attribute filtering in DynamoDB since the number of returned records (what you pay for) only depends on PKs and SKs.
In DynamoDB my first approach was to &quot;overload&quot; (I don't know if this is the right word for concatenating fields in PK/SK) the SK like . But this only allows me to filter
all orders by specific editor regardless the object
all orders by specific editor for specific object (also excluding that object)
the above combined within a creation date range
I could create GSIs with different &quot;overloaded&quot; SKs and could use thise for key and sort key conditions.
Do you know any hints / strategies for my scenario?

66402881,Safe coding practices,"I'm starting a new C/C++ embedded app and am trying to educate myself about safe coding practices like MISRA, AUTOSAR and my current favorite probably because it's the shortest, NASA's so-called Power of 10 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Power_of_10:_Rules_for_Developing_Safety-Critical_Code).  I can see the logic behind much of the rules.  But all of them try to eliminate or restrict dynamic memory allocation.  For example, MISRA C++ rule 18-4-1 says: âDynamic heap memory allocation shall not be usedâ and NASA's rule 3 is &quot;Avoid heap memory allocation&quot;.  AUTOSAR is somewhat less restrictive.  I understand their intent is to make sure a system doesnât run out of memory but I'm not really clear about what a C or C++ compiler allocates as &quot;dynamic heap memory allocation&quot; or &quot;heap memory allocation&quot;.  I'll edit this post to ask specific questions
Does that mean for example that all variables need to be static? (already answered by @klutt
Just to make sure I understand correctly, are temporary variables defined inside methods declared on the stack and therefore &quot;safe&quot; according to the MISRA, AUTOSAR and NASA guidelines?
&quot;newâ canât be used after initialization according to the AUTOSAR and NASA guidelines?
The C++ library array is OK according to the MISRA, AUTOSAR and NASA guidelines?
But C++ libraries like string and vector canât be used according to the AUTOSAR and NASA guidelines?

66402878,"Rendering PHP, SCSS, JS, Blade-Files from Blade-Files","Currently I am struggling with finding the best approach, to implement the following, maybe not everyday, requirement.
I plan to develop a Laravel application. The very general idea of this application is to generate the for websites, which are based on Laravel too, but completely working independent. So as an example: I, as an user, login to the Laravel application, create a new record âWebseiteâ in the database and have, letâs say about 50 settings to individualize the website. To have some example of settings, this could be: the logo on the website, decision if the website should have a blog or not, the theme color to used in bootstrap variables, etc.
After I have configured the website, I press a button and the Laravel application generates the code for this website, which works on Laravel too. In our case, we are building Statamic websites. So, after this process, I can download a Zip or even better everything gets moved to a new Git repository for this website and in this repository, I have all the files (app, bootstrap, config, content, database, .env.example, etcâ¦) I need to get my Statamic running on any server.
Now I have just to clone this new generated repository (or upload the Zip) to any server, run composer install &amp; cp .env.example .env and website is ready to go.
In other words, with this Laravel application I want to write/generate code for another Laravel website. Code in this case means:
PHP (configs, routes, â¦)
YAML (Statamic blueprints, â¦.)
Statamic Templates (would prefer to you blade for Statamic instead of Antlers)
JS (frontend)
SCSS (frontend)
And in all these files, I need to use blade-directives as I need to manipulate all these files, depending on the settings of the website.
Without a doubt, itâs technically no problem to do this. To have an config-app-php.blade.php which renders the config/app.php, or to have a app-scss.blade.php, etc.
But for me, it feels wrong to re render PHP, SCSS, JS or even worst, Blade-Template-files from Blade-Template-Files 
Do you have any ideas, if there is a better way to implement this?

My issue is, specifically with actions that change scenes/roots. The aspect of the controller/scene that is being tested, changes the root at the end, which produces the following stack trace:
My solution for that, was, as you might be able to discern, that I created a service wrapper class for the static methods in  (such as  causing the NPE), which, if I had access to the controller, I could theoretically mock with Mockito. Unfortunately, if you go back to the code example above, there doesn't seem to be any notion of access to the controller class. You get surface level creation and interaction with the stage, but the underlying controller I can't figure out how to access. Of course I need to access the physical controller in order to mock its service class.
Does anyone know how I might gain access to that class, so that I can set its wrapper class to a mocked version?

Something like (I am simplifying):
Obviously this is not optimal (in particular I don't like re-parsing the expression at every loop). I also looked at closures, though they would need to be defined by the user one by one and that doesn't sound like a good idea.
Is there a &quot;proper&quot; way to do this?
It is not mandatory to have an input file, it just looked like the most straightforward way to provide a long list of expressions (possibly hundreds). It would totally possible to define some sort of interface and have the user define a custom function, if that simplifies the code (suggestions?).

66402805,"Focus fix for CSS-only, responsive nav menu support using <details>","Context
I'm trying to build a navigation hamburger menu for a site on smaller screens and am trying to avoid adding JS as much as possible in the hopes of keeping the site more semantic and less complex, though I recognize adding complex CSS can be more confusing than some JS approaches. The requirements I have are
The menu button should only be present when the screen is below a certain size (e.g. )
In small windows, the menu items should only be present when the menu is &quot;open&quot;
If a user resizes the window to be bigger, the nav items should become present and styled for wider screens, regardless of menu being &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; before.
I have a functional nav bar today using a checkbox and sibling selector . I then can use traditional CSS with media queries to override the styling of the  and its children and hide/show the checkbox. This approach seems to be a fairly common pattern.
That solution works fine enough but I think a slightly more semantic way of managing this would be with a  and  field as that semantically has an &quot;open/close&quot; state rather than &quot;checked/unchecked&quot; state. I can style the summary how I want to get my menu button and can get the items to be visible, even when the  element is not open by sticking it in the , which is not semantic. This allows me to change the styling of the presentation based on media queries as well as  selectors.
Example Code Pen: https://codepen.io/quittle/pen/mdOxewM
Resize this window to see the menu appear/disappear: https://codepen.io/quittle/full/mdOxewM
Problem
The one remaining issue I'm facing with my implementation is disabling focus support on the  element on larger screens. While I can style away the menu button and configure the menu items differently, there is still a focus stop on the  box encompassing the menu that I can't get rid of. In small windows, I need this focus/interactivity as that is what shows/hides the menu. In large windows, it is a toggleable element that makes no UI change. I do not want to use JS to manipulate the dom to detect the window size if at all possible.
What I've tried
I've tried using  with  for each of the entries but the children are still stubbornly unable to be navigated to by tabbing.
I could compromise by doing the checkbox trick, but with a  alongside the  instead in the hopes that it provides a better accessibility experience than the .

66402739,(Advice on Part C) - Do you consider the different probabilities of events when doing a random sample? (in R),"I'm not super knowledgable in R, so would really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance!
A) My main issue is whether I should be considering the different probabilities of events in a random sample and how exactly to do that.
For instance, out of the oranges I have, 71% are super juicy, 22% are medium juicy, and 7% are mildly juicy. There are three distributions I am drawing from: super juicy, medium juicy, and mild juicy (based on juice level). Super juicy has mean of 400 and sd of 100. Medium juicy has mean of 300 and sd of 75. Mild juicy has mean of 200 and sd of 60.
I want to create a juiciness rating for the juice I'll be making out of the oranges. The juiciness rating is defined as the mean rating of the oranges used in the juice.
Since I want to do a random sample of 15 oranges, my code looks like this:
set.seed(4000)
samples=rnorm(15, mean=c(400,300,200), sd=c(100,75,60))
This should spit out the 15 randomly sampled oranges and their respective juiciness rating.
Then, to make the rating of the entire juice, I do:
rating.juice=mean(samples)
rating.juice
Is this correct? I'm not sure if I should consider the fact that out of the oranges, 71% are super juicy, 22% are medium juicy, and 7% are mild juicy.
B) I then am unsure how to do a stratified random sample where I would randomly sample oranges within each juiciness level to have a sample that contains 3 super juicy oranges, 8 medium juicy oranges, and 2 mild juicy oranges. What I have is:
set.seed(2021)
sample.super.juicy=rnorm(3,mean=400,sd=100)
sample.medium.juicy=rnorm(8, mean=300,sd=75)
sample.mild.juicy=rnorm(2, mean=200, sd=60)
rating=mean(c(sample.super.juicy, sample.medium.juicy, sample.mild.juicy))
rating
Is this correct?
Would this be the place to consider the different probabilities of each orange: 71% are super juicy, 22% are medium juicy, and 7% are mild juicy.
C) To compute the probability that the juice selected with oranges via part A has a juiciness level between 250-300, would I use pnorm? How would this approach differ from oranges selected in part B? I was confused on how to calculate the probabilities for each (A and B) since i'm not sure whether to use pnorm or ppois?

66402668,How to stream video to more than one client using Django development server,"I am trying to stream video to multiple browsers using opencv and django on a raspberry pi. In the code I share below, I am able to see my video stream on a different computer which is great, but when another computer tries to access the stream it just gets a blank screen. If I close the stream on the first computer, the second computer will now be able to access it.
So my question is, is this due to my code, or is this due to a limitation of the django development server, and I need to use gunicorn/nginix or similar production level?

I'm looking into upgrading the RAM in my Dell Precision M6700. According to some sources, this laptop supports up to 32GB 1866MHz DDR3 SODIMM (4x8GB), however Dell's official documentation would indicate that this system only supports 32GB as 1600MHz DDR3 SODIMM, but supports only 16GB when using DDR3 1866MHz... (see foot of post for link to screenshot of Dell's document)
Can anyone please elaborate further on the respective limitations of these specs? Though I am highly experienced in dealing with hardware upgrades, this is the first time I have come upon the issue of a system supporting only 50% of maximum capacity, when using higher frequency modules.
Further to this, could anyone offer an opinion as to whether it would be better to use 32GB@1600MHz, or 16GB@1866MHz? Would the potential increase in clock frequency outweigh the benefits of having 32GB@1600MHz? My most frequently performed operations do involve virtualization, however I rarely use multiple VM's simultaneously. It's very rare that I exceed 12GB of used RAM. I do however, spend upwards of 6-8 hours per day multitasking multiple IDE's and perform file transfers over gigabit intranet.
Any advice or helpful opinions would be greatly appreciated!

During regular operation this software converts data to a common format to send to machines for processing. One issue we just discovered in the package is that text in certain fields causes the conversion application to crash. When this error happens, it can cause significant delays in processing the requests, especially if the right people miss the issue. I have narrowed it down to a subset of special characters (e.g. @ # ^ ' $ !). The issue has been further narrowed down to when the special characters are copied from Microsoft Word.
Institutionally, it will be effectively impossible to convince people to stop copying notes they already have in Word into the software. What I would like to do is process each day's job list and check the database entries that get converted for any lingering characters. I don't need to replace them, just flag the jobs and fields for fixing.

66402537,Sign-up procedure design using Feathersjs,"I have a question regarding the design of the sign-up procedure using FeatherJS for the back-end of my application.
The problem I'm facing is the following:
I want a user to be able to sign-up his organisation/company using his/her email and a password. This user can be considered as the administrator of the organisation.
When that admin user has been created I want that same user to be able to create additional users that are linked to his/her organisation. To ensure that only the admin user can create additional users I've set up feathers-permission to check for 'admin' rights in the &quot;before&quot; hook of the &quot;Users&quot; service
The issue that I am encountering now is that I cannot sign-up the initial user because the before hook is requesting an authenticated user that has admin rights which I don't have because that user hasn't been created yet.
I could remove the authentication and permissions check but then I leave my User service &quot;unprotected&quot; and anyone would be able to create a user using the right POST call to the server.
The question I have is: How should I setup my service and/or hooks so that I can sign-up a new user in my application and that only that authenticated admin user can create new users in the application?
Many thanks in advance!",,0,0,,2021-02-27 19:14:20.643000+00:00,,2021-02-27 19:14:20.643000+00:00,,,,,15268992,,1,0,feathersjs|feathers-authentication|feathers-hook|feathers-service,7
