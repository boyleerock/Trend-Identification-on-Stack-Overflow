65100353,Refresh a Random in Google Sheets,"I have a functioning random value generator within a cell in google sheets, that pulls randomly from a range of cells, like this:
This function works as expected. The issue I am having is that I'd like to be able &quot;refresh&quot; the value on demand such that it pulls a new random cell upon refresh.  Placing the cursor in the cell and hitting enter on the keyboard doesn't seem to do it, and there doesn't seem to be a &quot;refresh&quot; feature in sheets.
Oddly, changing the value in literally any cell on the spreadsheet triggers the function and I get a new random value.  The trouble is that I do not want to have to change the contents of other cells to get the random to refresh.
How is this done?",,0,1,,2020-12-02 00:00:08.360000+00:00,,2020-12-02 00:00:08.360000+00:00,,,,,1639164,,1,0,google-sheets,22

65100358,How should I deal with Activestate removing PPM from their Perl?,"I'm an occasional Perl developer on Windows and Linux. I write or modify Perl scripts a few times a year when Perl is the right tool. With occasional use, I've never become a real Perl expert, but I succeed with the great help I receive in this forum.
Whenever I build or upgrade a machine, I get the latest Perl version. In 2020, I noticed Activestate was forcing logging in with an account before downloading. I did that, and didn't think much about it at the time.  Later I need to add some modules, and discovered that PPM has been deprecated and removed.
That seems like a pretty big deal - like installing the latest Ubuntu and discovering apt-get has been eliminated. My understanding is Perl users are supposed to go back to Activestate and have them build a custom installer that bundles desired modules, and then re-install Perl with every change. That seems a step backwards.  Is it a step toward controlling the user base, and eventually turning a free Perl into the &quot;Perl of great price&quot;?
What does the Perl community think about this, and what do you recommend? Am I misinterpreting the State Tool and how it works? Are you sticking with ActiveState, moving to Strawberry Perl, or something else?",,2,4,,2020-12-02 00:01:06.303000+00:00,,2020-12-03 21:15:53.610000+00:00,2020-12-03 21:15:53.610000+00:00,,2836621.0,,82287,,1,2,perl|activestate,154

It doesn't make any sense to have StackPanels or a Grid with only one child control each.
Try replacing your DockPanel with appropriately sized Grid Rows and Columns.

There's no need to define an ItemTemplate for the ListBox just to display a single string.

The technique you need is event delegation:
any click on a child element is also a click on its parent elements. we plas the event listener on the parent and we see on which child element it occurred.
In your case, this only makes one event listerner for all your 'remove' buttons.
the other idea is not to ignore the DOM, it also keeps the list of tasks, you don't need to keep them in a table in memory, this is redundant.
here is the code: css is also helfull
As you can see this code is shorter. You can also use a IIFE unstead of a class, like that :

I also tried the following code to minimize the second workbook from within VBA.  If the second workbook was already minimized, there was no effect.  If the second workbook was not minimized, the screen flickered only once - to enable me to minimize the second workbook.  Subsequent switching back and forth between workbooks did not introduce any screen flickering.
