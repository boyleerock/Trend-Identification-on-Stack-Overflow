26339490,How is git push through network working? (proxy),"I'm wondering how  works. I'm behind a proxy and even configuring it in my PhpStorm soft doesn't work.
So, I'm wondering how it is sent trough network, I guess using the port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS.
I read a bunch of threads on SO but couldn't figure out what's wrong there.
I guess &quot;my&quot; proxy doesn't have WebDAV enabled as explained here: Can&#39;t push to github through proxy
But I would like to know if anything else could be the source of the issue here, knowing that all ports are closed, excepted 80, 22 and 443.
Solution:
Not secured proxy (http)
If the proxy is not secure then you can configure it using:
And disable it using:
Secured proxy (https)
And disable it using:
Note that if you are under Windows and using TortoiseGit, you can set the proxy settings from the software itself. (Network tab)
If you're using Cygwin then be aware that if you set the global config it will be set only for the current environment. (Using cmd.exe will set it for Windows, but using the cygwin console will set it for cygwin only)
So, if you're using Git through an IDE (PhpStorm, WebStorm) be sure to have set the config in the environment used by the IDE, or it will not work.
Be also aware that if you have set the proxy in git setting and you're not behind the proxy, it will not work neither. (i.e: You've set it at work and it works fine, but when you're using it at home it doesn't work anymore while it used to work before)",26352390.0,3,4,,2014-10-13 11:59:41.017000+00:00,7.0,2019-11-10 05:47:13.483000+00:00,2020-06-20 09:12:55.060000+00:00,,-1.0,,2391795.0,,1,14,git|proxy,9616

26339347,State machine: validation before initial save in database?,"This is a question regarding state machines in general, I don't need help with the actual implementation. Imagine a state machine that formalizes a simple bug report, from inception to its final demise. The bug might transition across states such as ""NEW"", ""CONFIRMED"", ""RESOLVED"", ""REOPENED"", and ""CLOSED"". Along with every state transition there is also some accompanying validation code, which could for instance make sure that when moving from NEW to CONFIRMED we have recorded who confirmed it.
My question is related to the initial state – when the bug is just ""NEW"". It's tempting to say that initial validation is not part of the state machine (e.g. making sure that the bug actually has some description, for instance, before saving it with state ""NEW"" in the database). But isn't that also a state transition, from ""just created"" to ""NEW""? Shouldn't that transition be validated like any other transition? Isn't it artificial and sub-optimal to separate the initial validation from all other validations?
On the other hand, if we do create a ""fake"" initial state (say, ""CREATED""), along with its respective transition (""CREATED"" --> ""NEW""), then what happens when that transition isn't validated? If it is validated, it's all good – we switch states and we save the object with the new state (actually called ""NEW"" here) in the database. But if it doesn't validate then we obviously don't want to save it in the database, and that breaks the state machine pattern by not having an initial state and a final state (we would have an initial state, albeit a fake one – ""CREATED"" –, but two final states – ""CLOSED"" and ""DELETED""). Not only that, but the ""DELETED"" state would also be fake, in that there will never be any persistent objects with that state (just as there will never be any persistent objects with state ""CREATED"").

I decided to create a CSV file from my database (around 1 million entries) and to load it from the Neo4j webadmin to test it. The problem is that each row of this database contains redundant data, for example my database contains actions from different users but each user can do mutliple actions. The structure of my graph would be to create a node for each user that is linked to each action he does. That's why I have to create only one node for each user even if his name appears in several rows of my CSV file (because he made several actions). What is the method to do that ? I guess it's possible to do that in Cypher right ?

26339303,How to check for existence of subtree in XML document,"I need to check if an XML document contains a given XML DOM subtree. I only need to ensure that all the elements and attributes from this subtree are present in the document. However, there can be more elements or attributes in the subtree of the document that matches the given subtree for comparison. And I want them to be skipped from the comparison.
So far I have implemented my own solution which finds a subtree represented by Node class in the given XML document. This Node class contains only the attributes necessary for comparison - element name, text content, list of child nodes and map of attributes. I have implemented my own class and not used org.w3c.dom.Node because it is just too big containing many unnecessary attributes for my test scenario. The subtree represented by the root Node element is iterated one element after another and each its subtree is searched in the given XML document using XPath until the whole tree is checked or any subtree is not found.
This solution works well only when I need to check if the subtree is present there or not. However, I use this to check large configuration files that are often changed and it is quite difficult to find the exact place where the change occurred. That is why I think about using some existing solution which has better output and allows to easily see the differences. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find anything matching my criteria.
Is there any tool that allows this?

Can you show me an example how to do this in XMLUnit if it is possible?",,1,0,,2014-10-13 11:49:17.730000+00:00,,2015-02-03 16:51:31.593000+00:00,,,,,3047439.0,,1,1,java|xml|comparison|xmlunit,212

If the user passes through the value 2, then I would need to get all the employees who report to all the employees that were selected in the first list. If the user passes the value 3, then I would get not only the first level employees, then second, but then I would get all the employees that report to the employees listed in second query. In my mind I would have to create a new table for each one of these queries then in the end combine the results to be returned as one table. Is that the correct approach?

26339237,"Why is the diamond case with its common ancestor used to explain Java multiple inheritance issue, instead of two unrelated parent classes?","This question might sound weird to Java people but if you try to explain this, it would be great.
In these days I am clearing some of Java's very basic concept. 
So I come to Inheritance and Interface topic of Java. 
While reading this I found that Java does not support Multiple Inheritance and also understood that, what I am not able to understand that why everywhere Diamond figure issue(At least 4 class to create diamond) is discussed to explain this behavior, Can't we understand this issue using 3 classes only.
Say, I have class A and class B, these two classes are different (they are not child class of common class) but they have one common method and they look like :-
Ok,Now say if Java supports Multiple inheritance and if there is one class which is the subclass of A and B like this :-
then compiler will not be able to find which method to call whether from A or B and that is why Java does not support Multiple Inheritance. So is there any thing wrong with this concept ? 
When I read about this topic I was able to understand Diamond issue, but I am not able to understand why people are not giving example with three class (If this is valid one, because we used only 3 classes to demonstrate issue so its easy to understand by comparing it to Diamond issue.)
Let me know whether this example does not fit to explain issue or this can also be  referred to understand issue. 
Edit:
I got one close vote here stating that question is not clear. 
Here is main question :-
Can I understand Why ""Java does not support Multiple Inheritance"" with 3 classes only as described above or I must need to have 4 classes (Diamond structure) to understand the issue.",26339439.0,6,8,,2014-10-13 11:45:49.283000+00:00,2.0,2014-10-18 04:46:28.767000+00:00,2014-10-18 04:46:28.767000+00:00,,647014.0,,647014.0,,1,27,java|multiple-inheritance|diamond-problem,3537

After a very little amount of requests, you have to pay (2.500/day right now)
Users must be connected to the internet 
That's why I tought that an offline-local solution would be better. There are many websites (like Maxmind) where you can download a list containing every city in the world.

As far as I searched the best choice for this task is RangeBar - unfortunately the type of chart used not so often. 
The code above works perfect until I draw only one of three series ( doesn't metter which one). It draws several horizontal bars, one by one on different levels with different names. But when more series is choosen many bars is connected with wrong names.
It looks like the chart does not read seconds from BEGIN/END fields so if two batches from different queues starts at the same hour and minute but different second they are wrongly interpreted.  
... it is pretty difficult to explain but I hope some of you understand what I mean and give me some hints what is wrong and how repair/solve my problem
thanks for any help in advance
ok, following Sinatr suggestions below the code which allows to show my problem. Right now, after a time spent on analyzes I see the problem is not with datetime format . It looks like a deeper one.
        Every series starts from the same object created by the first series - and this in wrong. Anyway look at code . Of course it expects chart object created on windows form
Batches A and A1 from first series are displayed correct, but B from second series are displayed as A :(",,1,3,,2014-10-13 11:40:16.563000+00:00,,2019-02-22 08:58:58.580000+00:00,2014-10-14 08:49:32.037000+00:00,,3863616.0,,3863616.0,,1,1,c#|charts,695

26339125,Calculated measure on role playing dimension?,"I have a ssrs report based on a ssas cube. In the report I want to group the companys results by organizational structure. The structure can change from year to year and the history is kept in a SCD 2 dimension. The organizational structure is grouped in 4 levels (Division, Work Area, Base unit, Responsible Unit). All results are registered on the lowest level. A usuall action is that a Resonsible unit is moved between Divisions. 
In the report I want to have 2 columns, the results for choosen year in the first column and the result for previous year in the second column. The user can choose wich year he/she wants to run the report for. In the cube I have created two Calculated measures, Result_current_year and Result_previous_year. My fact rows are connected to the dimension with a warehouseID (AE_WID_HISTORY).
Now to my problem. The measures are bound to the organizational structure that was present in that year. This is not what my customer wants. They want to compare the result from both years according to the organizational structure of the current year. 
My idea of solution is to create a new column in the fact table that holds the foreign key to the row of the dimension representing next years organizational structure. The problem is that this value doesnt exist when the row is created. To accomplish this I have to loop over the fact table the year after and update all rows with the correct value. In the cube I would then create a roleplaying dimension that represents next years organizational structure. In my calculated measure ""Result_previous_year"" I would then use this roleplaying dimension.
Is this possible and if YES, how would the MDX for the calculated measure ""Result_previous_year"" look?",,1,0,,2014-10-13 11:39:02.173000+00:00,,2014-10-13 20:02:17.767000+00:00,2014-10-13 13:42:02.583000+00:00,,3932781.0,,3932781.0,,1,0,reporting-services|ssas|mdx,150

26339100,Buck - building android app with multiple Gradle flavors/build types and manifests,"I'm working on a project where we have several modules, each one of these with a number of dependencies to other modules, and so on and so forth. We migrated our project to Gradle (and also changed the structure to accommodate it to Gradle's defaults) some time ago because we needed versatility when building different versions of the app: free vs paid, debug (no proguard) vs release (proguard), etc. We were really thrilled when we completed the migration, but this happiness quickly became diluted in a puddle of mud when the build time started to become a pain. Making a rather simple change in the code and deploy the app on the phone takes anywhere 90-120 seconds, and that is simply unacceptable.
So we decided to give Buck a try, as we have heard nothing but good words from other developers. After very little time (way less than with Gradle) we managed to build our app successfully (which, unfortunately, doesn't mean ""generating an APK correctly"", but at least it built). The thing is that, as a general rule, we have one manifest file per flavor, and unless I have overlooked something fundamental, Buck only lets you specify manifest files when using the rule . The result of this is that the generated APK's manifest file contains only the boilerplate code of the first level module from which Gradle's build chain starts:
That is, the manifest file only contains main's manifest. This rule is located in the top level BUCK file, which is the file that contains the alias specified in .buckconfig.
I'm pretty sure I'm doing something wrong. It wouldn't make sense Buck doesn't allow you to not have multiple manifests.

I've been digging into the scheduled tasks on the server to investigate if there is something that puts the server to it's knees in performance without any findings. 
I've also gone so fas so that I've made a watchdog for the application so that when the query only has 1 seconds left of it's max query time it checks the processlist for the database and emails this to me. The process list always contains just one entry and that's the entry that is about to get an timeout exception.
To further add to the complexity we have many customers to this application but it's only one of the customers that get this timeout. All customers run the same code but have different databases, different application pools with different application pool identities. 
The application is an ASP.net application. The database is a Microsoft SQL 2008 R2 Express edition.
Has anyone heard of something like this? Can anyone give me any pointers about what to investigate in order to resolve this issue?

I am trying to use openID for this. I have read about openID and found following:
In our existing users table, we will add an other field 'openid_identity'. While login, we will send Google login and password to Google and get response. From response, we will get user's identity and then by matching it with the identity in database, we can get user details.
One thing that is not clear:
In our application, admins can create users. Users can then login with their email (like john@myapp.com) and password.
Initially, before using Google sign in, our user's table 'openid_identity' field will be empty. How can we handle OpenID login for first time? What do we show to user? A 'signup with Google' page? If user signs up with their Google mail (like 'john@gmail.com'), how can we know which user he is, from users table?",,1,1,,2014-10-13 11:30:11.410000+00:00,,2017-09-02 15:17:03.370000+00:00,2017-09-02 15:17:03.370000+00:00,,472495.0,,1206713.0,,1,4,php|authentication|openid,215

It's all part of an ongoing project they have to do.
However on my while loops I have an  condition inside them and if the condition isn't met the first time it just infinitely loops until I break.
The cipher here is 12 and if that is input it carries on as normal, however any other input just gives the error message and loops out forever.
