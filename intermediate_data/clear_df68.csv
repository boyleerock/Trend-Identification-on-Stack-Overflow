Long version: In reading a bunch of documentation about the  function, it's not 100% clear to me how its locale dependent behavior works.  Specifically I've found docs that say things like
In some locales, there may be additional characters for which isalpha is true--letters which are neither upper case nor lower case. But in the standard &quot;C&quot; locale, there are no such additional characters.
Additionally -- if I test this out with a small C program, I can confirm that  will return / for values outside of the traditional ASCII text ranges when a different locale is set -- for some unixes.  This program seemed to do reasonable things on my BSD/Darwin based mac -- but it segfaulted when I tried it on an ubuntu box.
What's unclear to me is how  knows which integers should return true when the locale is set to  and what those integers represent.  Is this just a hard coded list of utf code points in a range somewhere? Or something less direct?
I tried chasing this down myself but my pigeon-c was not up to the task.
I got as far as  and .  If I dive into the source of glibc I see that the  function is actually a macro that expands to something like this
 is also a macro, so we expand that out we have something like

This problem occurs on my new monitor that has a resolution of 3440x1440 pixels (21:9).
For example, when I want to watch a movie in the VLC player, but also on Netflix, it's especially strange:
I started watching the third season of Star Trek Discovery today. The first episode fills my screen perfectly, the second episode has black borders all around, subtitles protrude slightly beyond the black border (so theyr relative position on the screen is are where they always are).

My understanding: The documentation is a bit unclear, but it seems that, while iterating through the list of images, it will perform the function defined under  using each item of the array (filling the  parameter in my case). There is mention of a key property, but it seems as though this is optional, and that if omitted, the library will default to the use of indices (essentially iterating through the array in order from index 0 to the end, and rendering each item). I've tried multiple methods of implementing key properties, and yet I cannot find a solution that results in a defined &quot;data&quot; property.

 is a named range, perhaps equal to your 'Cases Test for Categories'!$C$18:$C$55. The reason for using a name is obvious. It's shorter. In my test List = A2:B6, in case you want to reconstruct it. Column 1 has names, column 2 numbers.
The term  specifies the second column of List. You can replace the '2' with a formula to specify different columns of the named range.
In fact,  does specify the first column and  specifies the 4th cell in that column, and that is exactly what you see in my formula. All of MATCH(LARGE(INDEX(List, ,2),1),INDEX(List,,2),0) just serves to find the row number in List, in this example the number 4.
Of course,  returns the largest number in column2 of List. The '1' can be replaced by a formula, for example  which would return 1 if placed in row 2 and count up from there as it's copied down. Try  in any cell in row 2 and copy the formula down.
MATCH([LARGEST],INDEX(List,,2),0) returns the row number where the largest was found, and that is the number we need to return the name from the first column of List.
This will work perfectly for one column and can easily be modified to work for different columns. Your question doesn't specify how you would like to arrange the 5 results from each category but the formula can be modified a little to accommodate whatever you want. What it can not do is to deal with ties. MATCH(LARGE can only find the first of several identical results.
To break ties in this sort of operation is complicated and must be done ether by helper columns in the data table or using VBA. It's definitely the topic of another question. For now I hope that it's a problem you will not have to anticipate."

In all cases the argument is an int, the value of which shall be representable as an unsigned char or shall equal the value of the macro EOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.
The loop :  is just undefined behavior for any  greater then . Some programmers even do . (I remember getting a warning in some cases when  functions arguments was not an unsigned char).

Yes, as mentioned above in  files.

How you update the table cells depends on how the data is stored.

However, if at all possible, the easier solution is to store each movie's data as an object. This is a perfect use case.
