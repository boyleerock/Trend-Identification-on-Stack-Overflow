Additionally, WordPress has an amazing Capabilities API that goes far beyond Roles.  I would strongly recommend reading up on it.
For a brief example, if I wanted to grant a user access to manage WordPress options (a capability called  that is inherited from the Administrator role), all I have to do is say  or use the  function. 
Matching based on capabilities is usually much more flexible that matching on a Role... for example imagine my site had a second role called ""Developers"". If you gated access based on roles, and you wanted to give users in the developer role access to your feature, you would need to add a second check whenever you need to verify a users permissions: 
So, if you have a user logged in already then you can always verify their capabilities with:
or define your own custom cap, give it to all administrators:
and check the custom cap against the current user
The added benefit to capabilities is that WordPress will automatically check the current user's permissions when rendering the WP Admin menu if you register your admin section with one of the add_*_page functions (add_menu_page()) and a capability like 'manage_options'
Lastly, It was a bit unclear as to whether you were logging in users yourself, if so I would propose this alternative if you are logging in the user from scratch (i.e. not using WordPress's login form):
You will also need to call  during every page load of your custom admin to verify that the user is logged in and has permissions, if that fails, then direct them to your custom login page... or possibly, the wordpress login page with auth_redirect()."

1) Add a media-query conditional (such as ) around the vertical centering block of CSS so that it becomes disabled on shorter screens, and reverts to a normal scrollable page.
2) Use a full-height flexbox container to control the centering instead of relative positioning. If done correctly, it can have the same effect with a lot less code.

Customer
Order
Order_item
Item
So first we have to mention the database relationships in the model. e.g. a customer have many orders. So in Customer model indicate it as a function as follows.
public function order(){
} 
Also in the Order Model 
public function  customer(){
}
When crating the migration file you should leave unsigned intiger column for customer_id in the orders table. When saving the data you should save the relevant customer_id in the order details. e.g.
orders table will look like follows.
id(unsigned, aoutoincrement, integer)
customer_id(unsigned, integer)
total_price
etc
And keep in mind that to save the auto increment id in the customer table to orders table customer_id. Or let laravel do this for you by using the handy method or like,
$order->customer_id=$customer->id //assuming that you have the customer object crated above.
However i prefer to save the id manually since its more clear for me.
So when ever you want to find the customer of the certain order look back in the customer table with the customer id. e.g.
$customer=Customer::where('id',$order->customer_id)->first();
If you want to find the orders of a particular Customer you can do it like ,

A month can be 28, 29, 30 or 31 days. A year can be 365 or 366 days. And since a period is independent of any fixed date, there is no way to decide these relations.

Furthermore, there is no mechanism to do a single service side operation against two different tablets.

2.0,2014-11-20 09:03:18.377000+00:00,"Using  as a font property in iText was a design flaw. I am responsible for that poor design choice, mea culpa. If you consult ISO-32000-1, you'll notice that strikethru is not a property of a font (), nor is it possible to set that property on a field. Hence, it is impossible to fill out a field with ""stroked through"" content, unless you'd find a font that contains such characters (as indicated by mkl in his comment).
There are two other possible workarounds depending on the final result you want to get.
You can define your own default appearance () for the form field. In this appearance, you could draw the text and a line that strikes through it. I am not going to give you an example on how to do this, because it is not a good solution: the form remains interactive and the moment the end user clicks the field, Adobe Reader will replace the  with an appearance created on the fly in the viewer. This appearance will show the text without the strikethru.
If it is acceptable for you that the form is flattened, then I would fill out the field the hard way. That is: retrieve the coordinates of the field and draw the text at those coordinates using . For an example, see my answer to this question: How to continue field output on a second page?"

This tutorial shows you how to properly implement SQLite and use Linq extensions to interact with your database tables. I have copied the relevant parts below. Once you have your database connection open, and have created your data first tables, you can then interact with the table as you would with any IEnumerable with Linq. It does also provide an option of passing in SQL as a string, however as this is not checked at compile time, you run the risk of having runtime errors. 
https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/xamarin-forms/application-fundamentals/databases/
The TodoItemDatabase constructor is shown below:
This approach creates a single database connection that is kept open while the application runs, therefore avoiding the expense of opening and closing the database file each time a database operation is performed.
