65275340,How to back scale the coefficient after feature normalization in Multivariate Linear Regression,"I have written below python code to find function of Multivariate Linear Regression using gradient descent. I have used feature normalization on input features and able to come up with w1,w2,w0 that minimize the loss. However, these number of w1,w2,w0 are the weights calculated after the x1, x2, and y are normalized.
My goal is to get simple number of the coefficient (w1,w2) of x1, x2, and intercept(w0) to form a linear equation, which predicts y from raw input features (x1,x2). I have tried converting w1,w2,w0 by multiply it with std, then plus mean. However, the result wasn't right. I think I need to back scale the coefficient to get what I want. However, I am stuck, and hope someone could help me with this.
Below are the code, and the result.

65275332,,"There are 2 main options here, and as a first step I would see if you can make the first option work, in line with Mohammad's comment:
OPTION 1: SIMPLE LOGOUT
Just remove any stored tokens from your app. The problem with this is that it does not remove the Authorization Server Session Cookie. So by default you cannot force another login prompt, eg to sign in as a new user. One way around this is to send prompt=login as a parameter when performing the login redirect.
OPTION 2: FULL LOGOUT
A full logout involves both of these actions and may require you to dig into AppAuth internals:
Remove stored tokens from your app
Redirect to remove the Authorization Server session cookie, via an End Session Request
Here is some sample Android code of mine to spin up a Chrome Custom Tab for a logout redirect.
There are other potential issues, such as intermittent Chrome white screens that fail to return to the app after logout, due to a missing user gesture.
FURTHER INFO
My blog posts have some further details on AppAuth integration, along with code samples you can run, in case any of this is useful. I am using AppAuth libraries directly from Kotlin / Swift, whereas you need to deal with an additional layer of the Flutter Plugin:
