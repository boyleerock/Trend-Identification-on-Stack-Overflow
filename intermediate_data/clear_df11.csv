I am getting an error on this line of code stating: Run-time error '1004' Application-defined or object-defined error.
Most of this I do not understand it is simply some hand me down code that I am trying to re-purpose. The old code which still works is this:
The difference between these is that instead of just dropping it in one set cell with the code pulling over couple hundred thousand lines of data is I want the code to be in the first blank row and only pull over that one record. But each time it runs it needs to go to the next row.
With the old code it made an actual table which I am guessing is related to the fact that at the end it states QueryTable. I would rather just have the data and not the table format. If there is a way to change it to do this that would be great.
Also in the previous version of this the query only pulled from one table and the  link to the file. The new code will need to link to two tables so there are two files as I was unable to have it make a connection file with two tables selected. If you can help with that as well that would be great.
I am using Excel 2013 Standard and  SQL Server 2012. Please let me know if you need any more info.

I am well aware I can do that - this is obviously an example, the real code is much more complicated and requires a STORED PROCEDURE. Note, I intentionally return a string from the sample stored proc - I need complex values, not just .
Edit:
SQL Server 2012
Functions are NOT an option. I apologize for the confusion. My &quot;function&quot; needs to call built in Stored Procs, and functions can't do that.
Edit 2: The reason I need an SP, rather than a function, is because I need to dynamically find the primary key of some table, so I need to use dynamic SQL. I thought this was too much info, but looks like it's necessary:
