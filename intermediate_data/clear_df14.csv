1.0,2020-11-28 15:15:20+00:00,"I would like to adjust the return value of a method from an instance class and I am not quite sure if it is possible with or without Reflection. I could not figure it out and so I wanted to ask it here. Lets say I have for example the following class Foo:
Some context:
Foo class is from an external library
Foo class is not adjustable
Foo class is not extendable
So with this basic example I would like to get Bar returned from the method getName() instead of Foo. To be very explicit:
Why do I need this?
Well I need to pass this instance of Foo to another method which only accepts an object of the type Foo. This method will call the method getName() and will do some additional calculation.
Actual use case:
I will try to give more context, hopefully it will be a bit more clear. There is a method within a builder class which is accepting an instance of  a method called . This builder class will internally call  on the KeyManagerFactory and it will return 
The KeyManagerFactory is a final class, it doesn't have a public constructor at all. The getKeyManager method is also final. I already have a  and so I want to hack this KeyManagerFactory to return my own array own KeyManagers instead and supply it to the builder."

One of them is database first - a database managed by a legacy enterprise application and I don't have full control over changing the database structure.

Security policies prevent me from making a view that joins tables from the two database servers in the code first DB which might be a way to make this better according to what i've seen on SO posts.
I have one context for each database since they are separate.
The data and structure in the code first tables is designed to be able to join to the non-code first database as if they were all in one database.

Again, this works and gets my data back in a reasonable but clearly not optimal timeframe that I can work with in my UI that needs this by preloading the data before it is needed. Not the best, but works.

What i'm trying to do is: when I click on any datagridview's cell of the first column(the id's column), it opens a new form, ask me a choice between the language EN/FR/IT (I guess a listbox within the form), asks me the type of document, &quot;electricity bill&quot; / &quot;gaz bill&quot; / &quot;leisure bill&quot; and then build my output string with the answers I gave or clicked on. Let's say for example, I double cliked on the ID 3 within the datagridview, and selected &quot;English&quot; and &quot;electricity bill&quot; from the form that poped up. Then, it build a string which will ultimately be a hyperlink like this: C://folder/personId3_electricityBill_EN thats will give me the electricity bill of person 3 in english stored in my pc at this adress.

Now I use a datagridview to display my data, and there isn't any other tab where I can map the things (for the better I guess).

I’ve attempted to wipe this all clean, reinstall Verdaccio, etc, etc, nothing seems to fix the issue. I can’t seem to make this package go away, OR to get it to display in the UI either.
