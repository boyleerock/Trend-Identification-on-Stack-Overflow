  How to split a git repository while preserving subdirectories?  
At one point I added my code to an existing git repo, and have committed to it quite a lot since, while the other developer has committed to the other existing files in the repo.  Now I want to split my code off into its own repo, but preserve all the change history for my particular files.
Reading through what others have done for splitting code out I was looking at  and doing  or  with  commands for the files I don't care about.  I don't want to use  as it is not appropriate for the subdir holding my code to be the topdir (also we shared one subdir).  To complicate matters, some of the files from the original repository have moved around a bit over time, and there are some files that were created then deleted.  This makes designing an rm list a bit... challenging.
I'm looking for a way to filter everything /except/ a list of files/directories.  Does anybody know of a way to do this?"

Firefox versions 6 - 13 seem to have serious image-rendering performance issues on Mac and Windows XP.
Whether I move multiple Images around in a DIV via  or using CSS3  or even in a canvas element the images stutter heavily while being moved around.
You can check my latest Canvas test here: http://jsfiddle.net/5YCmH/6/
My question is; why is this happening?
As I see and read it on the web CSS3 and Canvas should be hardware accelerated by now.
So I checked the various settings in about:config and even reset them to default. Nothing works. While Safari and Chrome are rendering everything smoothly, Firefox looks like IE7.
I tested on 3 different machines, same problem everywhere. Whats happening people?
Any pointers or insight would be helpful!
PS:
I haven't used FF much since I switched to Chrome like one year ago. Before that I made an image sliding widget and tested it in FF 3.6.xx and it worked smoothly (using the  approach). Now I'm testing code I primarily developed in WebKit browsers also in FF and it doesn't work at all.
Is this real life? I feel funny.

Basically, I'm attempting to fold the listview's first visible child backward as if a sheet of paper is being folded downward along the X axis. This goes on on continuously as the user scrolls up and down the list. This is my first time playing around with Matrix animations and Android's camera from the graphics api, so I'm definitely off the mark here. 
This is the effect I'm trying to achieve
And this is the effect I'm getting. 
I want the animation to begin at the origin(0,0) but both the left and right side, animating from the top of the list item instead of the upper left corner. I'm not very familiar with matrix translations or animations so If anyone much more experience with these techniques than myself can shed some knowledge, it'll be greatly appreciated.
Basically I'm overriding the onDrawChild method of ListView, grabbing the child's bitmap from a drawing cache, and using a matrix to perform the animation. The lighting and camera implementation is code that I took from another sample app in order to get the animation to look as 3D as possible. 
I tried playing around with the ListView animations library, but without much luck. I also tried to hack together a solution using code from the developer guides here that uses object animators to achieve a nice little card flip animation, but it started feeling a bit hacky and I couldn't quite get it the way I wanted.
Here's my current implementation. If anyone can shed some light or direction on this one, or maybe if anyone wrote an awesome library that I didn't come across on my searches, please feel free to share. Thanks"

I am somewhat unsure as to how an enum value is associated to a string input.

I saw that there could be a way of doing this with templates but I haven't learned anything about those just yet.

Quick code info
This one is just intended to read the tax category as a string and save it to the correct taxCategory variable. I'm not sure if I should remove the delimiter from the string as I can do that later. However, if the determination of the string and the calculation of the tax amounts per taxCategory need to have them removed then I'll figure out a way. 
This one is just intended to print the tax category to the screen of the user. The intent is to have the string moved to the right side in a list format.
