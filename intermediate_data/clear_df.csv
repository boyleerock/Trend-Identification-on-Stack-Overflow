This is a bit strange for me. Why does the MS Docs use  (optional marker)? Is the  argument really optional similarly to regualr option arguments, like ? Or it is just a syntactic sugar? So that's why I may call directly  in the editor, but the compiled code can be different (which is compatible with the reflection system too). If so, does that mean the method always receives the  value, even if I don't specify values?

Authorized to Fulfilling in first 30 seconds
Fulfilling to Settled in the second 30 seconds and
Settled to Delivered in the last 30 seconds.

Were there any Elasticsearch upgrades/patches around the time it started? The service provider told me there were not.
Was there in increase in Elasticsearch usage (ingestion/queries)? I see no deviation from the last month averages.
Is the status of the cluster green? Yes, the cluster is in green health status.
Are all the indexes having a green status? Yes, all the indexes have the green health status.

65444089,Stripe PaymentIntents + Subscription,"Anyone know how to make a Stripe subscription charge a card automatically on future period payments using the new PaymentsIntent SCA approach?
Stripe's docs are in need of major pruning. I've never seen such convoluted and confusing docs as these ones.
One of the confusing parts is where they say in the docs for PaymentsIntents:
If I put automatic, the handleCardAction doesn't work anymore on the front end. If it has to be manual, does that mean that all future recurring payments (say Month 2, 3, etc) will need some kind of SCA confirmation by the user?
I haven't found any elements examples for paymentintents and subscriptions with SCA and varying plans and prices not pre-set on the backend as they depend on each individual's parameters.
If I use manual and handleCardAction, the subscription stays incomplete, despite the payment going through. If I use confirmCardPayment, the SCA popup never shows.
Looking further into the subscription and intent objects, I noticed that a new subscription created on the server comes with its own paymentIntent object. So does it mean one has to stop creating a separate paymentIntent with own id? If you do, it doesn't work for completing the subscription, which stays as incomplete.
However, the subscription's paymentIntent has a confirmation_method set as automatic by default -- this results in an error after SCA on the frontend: &quot;You cannot confirm this PaymentIntent because it has already succeeded after being previously confirmed&quot;. Interesting, why did it ask for the SCA then in the status: &quot;requires_action&quot;?? Are we supposed to change manually the confirmation_method on a subscription to &quot;manual&quot;??
All this is quite confusing how to make subscription / paymentIntent work with SCA.
My logic is simple: user customises a subscription and enters card details, all of which gets sent to the server =&gt; Server creates a new plan, product, customer and subscription =&gt; Sends intent (from Subscription?) back to FE =&gt; If required, SCA is performed and the subscription is confirmed. Is this not how it's supposed to be done? I don't have pre-set plans as they can vary. I just need the ability to charge a user automatically the same amount they paid for the next period.
The examples and docs I've seen so far don't address the above use case.
