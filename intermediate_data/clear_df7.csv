Couldn't a single method be provided which returns all top-level attributes, drills down into  elements as necessary and resolves references?

So, in the foreach loop when I set the element with Id = 1 to Price = 0.00 I am immediately seeing this in the IList:
I feel like this is a totally stupid question to be asking and I will probably end up finding an equally stupid reason for it happening. I've used F11 to step into every line of code involved and don't see anyplace where Price is getting set in other elements. For that matter, MyClass is completely braindead to the existence of it being contained in an IList.
It seems like this is being caused in the loop itself. I've also tried this approach with the same behavior:
I've added a watch:
Stepping through the loop shows that when  is set to 0.00 all of the other elements' Price member get set to 0.00.
Is there any possible explanation for this behavior other than there being something causing this in my class? Possibly something to do with an IList?"

Let me explain.
User A is making an API call to view an entity. This call requires two steps.
Verify user A is authorized to view/edit the entity.
Return the entity to user A.
At the same time, User B is making a call to modify the entity. The new entity User B is posting not only adds new info to the entity, but also removes User A from the authorized users list. This call requires two steps.
Verify user B is authorized to view/edit the entity.
Update the entity with the new entity User B has provided.
If authorization is not atomic the back end may process the requests like this.
Verify user A is authorized to view/edit the entity. (From User A's API call)
Verify user B is authorized to view/edit the entity. (From User B's API call)
Update the entity with the new entity User B has provided. (From User B's API call)
Return the entity to user A. (From User A's API call)
This is problematic because User A would have received info he was not authorized to see.

Prior to this, we had a virtual server utilizing webmin as an interface and it ran on Ubuntu. 
The idea was to have some templates within ExpressionEngine which would contain functions that would be triggered every so often per hour. Naturally, this was where Cron came into play. These worked flawlessly for many weeks.
During the migration, Nexcess promised to port everything over (it was part of their appeal to both my company and the client. No additional work for either of us, in theory). 
These functions are now no longer firing.
The originals were lost and are now replaced with these (which I did not make, it was most likely Nexcess). They're not reaching the templates, and I know this because I can look at the hit counter. Further, manually firing each template delivers the desired result- so the code itself is fine.
The Cron commands are:
*Note that these templates are protected, and so a user name and password must be given for direct access. 
Any clue as to what the hold up is? 
On webmin I could actually run tests with Cron and see the output- no such luck with Nexcess and 'Siteworx' (insofar as I am presently able to divine). 
So the issue appears to be the host provider is using an outdated version of Wget. This older version has particular problems with SSL which are applicable in our case. They are suggesting we rebuild the statements using Curl.
What might the equivalents be for what we have above (I'm researching this actively as I ask this).

GROUP BY to the end are after the request has finished and you are altering the results that came back... so thats why the order by can cause the issues... when you include the member joined in the select it returns results that get counted and then reordered by date

may change based on the elements contained within a given statement;
in addition, this order is not guaranteed to be the same between
releases of the MySQL Server. In SELECT @a, @a:=@a+1, ..., you might
think that MySQL will evaluate @a first and then do an assignment
second. However, changing the statement (for example, by adding a
GROUP BY, HAVING, or ORDER BY clause) may cause MySQL to select an

I compared the hash produced here to my own hash, and it wasn't coming out the same. After correcting it by stripping whitespace and not reusing a hasher in a loop, this problem resolved.
So, Not Ready can result from a hashing issue behind the scenes, or an upload containing too few valid &amp; matching email addresses."

The URL has to be 100% correct. Unlike a browser there is no code to fix urls.
The purpose of my program is to get error details.
How I get a correct URL is to type my url in a browser, navigate, and the correct URL is often in the address bar. The other way is to use Properties of a link etc to get the URL.
Also Microsoft.XMLHTTP maps to Microsoft.XMLHTTP.1.0. HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\Msxml2.XMLHTTP maps to Msxml2.XMLHTTP.3.0. Try a later one
Try this way using xmlhttp. Edit the url's etc. If it seems to work comment out the if / end if to dump info even if seeming to work. It's vbscript but vbscript works in vb6. 
Also see if these other objects work.
Also be aware there is a limit on how many times you can call any particular XMLHTTP object before a lockout occurs. If that happens, and it does when debugging code, just change to a different xmlhttp object

What's New in MSXML 6.0
MSXML 6.0 shipped with SQL Server 2005. It also shipped as a Web release. The following is a high-level summary of features that were introduced with MSXML 6.0.
Security
A number of enhancements have been made to MSXML 6.0 to eliminate security threats. Additionally, some features that are insecure, such as DTDs and inline schemas, have been turned off by default. For more information, see MSXML Security Overview.
XDR Schema Support Removed
XML Data Reduced (XDR) schema support has been removed. For more information, see Removal of XDR Schema Support.
Improvements in XSD Standards Compliance
MSXML 6.0 has improved XSD schema standards compliance. For more information, see Improvements in XSD Standards Compliance.
Improvements in Schema Cache Behavior
MSXML 6.0 has changed the behavior of the XSD schema cache. The new version is less ambiguous when there are name collisions. For more information, see Improvements in Schema Cache Behavior.
XML Digital Signature Removed 
MSXML 6.0 removed support for XML digital signatures. For more information, see XML Digital Signatures.

Ports are specified by putting : at the end of URLs. eg;

Use Macro Recorder in Excel to record your data query which will write most of your code for you. But they are flexible and probably don't need to be programmed (excel is for non programmers to do programming stuff) - look at the option dialog while setting up the query."

Install ""ODAC 12c Release 3 and Oracle Developer Tools for Visual Studio""
Btw. I found this note on a Oracle website:
  Note: If you have installed ODAC 12c Release 3 configured on a machine-wide level, you will see an error when trying to generate database scripts using Entity Framework Model-First. To resolve this issue, use an ODAC version later than this release or reinstall ODAC 12c Release 3 with the ""Configure ODP.NET at a machine-wide level"" box UNchecked.
Add those nuget packages to you project:
EntityFramework (6.1.3 here)
Offical Oracle ODP.NET, Managed Entity Framework Driver (12.1.022 here)
Those will also add some dependent packages and insert the necessary configuration into the App.config.
Before generating the database, choose the correct T4 templates in the properties of the EDMX model before generating the database.
The pre-selected templates are designed for MS SQL Server (I guess)."
