65452692,Rust lazy_static and tokio::sync::mpsc::channel in tokio::select,"I started coding with rust lately and I'm loving it. I'm coding on a project where I want to &quot;wrap&quot; a C-API. In one case I have to define callbacks in Rust, which C can call. I let bindgen created the callbacks. Since the code need to run somewhat asynchronous, I'm using tokio for that.
What I want to achieve
I create the the main function as tokio::main. In the main function i create 2 async tasks, one listens for channels, the other triggers the message queue in the C-API. If messages are available I want to send them via a channel on the callback function, so I can receive the message on the task, where I am listening for events. Later I want to send these messages via SSE or a GraphQL subscription to several clients.
I can't change the C-Callbacks as they need to be passable to the C-API, and I have to use callbacks, otherwise I don't get the messages.
My latest approach looks simplified like that:
The problem:
I understand the message and why this happens, but I can't think of a solution how this could work.
I have a working example that uses crossbeam channels, but i'd rather use async channels from tokio, so i don't have so many dependencies and everything is async.
Working example:
Alternative
One alternative, that i have not get to work either, would be to use some sort of local function or to work with closures. But I'm not sure if, and even if, how this would even work. Maybe someone has an idea. It would be nice, if something like this would work, so i dont have to work with lazy_static (i'd rather not have global/static variables in my code)
The problem with this approach
It would be nice, if someone had a solution to either of my problems. If it's a completely new approach, that would be fine either. If channels or tokio or whatever is not the way to go, that's also fine. Mainly I used tokio, because a crate I'm also using tokio, so I don't have to have many more dependencies.

65452397,Neo4J TimeTree Queries,"I want to create log-event in a Neo4J application. The idea is to have a timetree and to attach a log-event-node to the according time-node at the second level. So for example a logevent happening today at 11 pm and 43 minutes would be attached to the 20 seconds level of that branch:
2020 - 12 - 25 - 11 - 43 - 20 &lt;-- Event-Node
In order to be flexible I do not want to create a fix timetree which needs maintenance and extension but adding nodes to the timetree on demand.
I start with checking, if the requested node(seconds) is existing on a branch:
Having a COUNT result &gt; 1 means the node exists so I can attach my logevent-node. If it doesnt I need to create that node.
Approach one was to use MERGE in ordert to avoid redundant nodes. When I merge the whole path I always get for every new constellation a complete path - this results in having for every second a complete path with all redundant nodes of minutes, hours, days etc.
Trying a MERGE on each node and also on the relation between the nodes avoids this but leads to unwandted links, e.g.
Here I get e.g. the node 9 of seconds connected to different minute-nodes as 9 exists and the merge would not make a new 9-node but connect the existing one to both paths. This will lead to problems in following a path upwards.
Is there a chance to make a query that checks, if the requested nodes exist and if not generates them but keep a tree structure without lateral relations between the nodes?
I can of course make several queries that check every constellation but this has no real beauty :)",,0,0,,2020-12-25 22:53:18.157000+00:00,,2020-12-25 22:53:18.157000+00:00,,,,,4183601.0,,1,0,neo4j,11

I'm getting the clients preferred locale from the  header. From the  header, I get the language and country code to help me figure out their preferred currency.  would be US dollars,  Canadian dollars, etc.
Here's the code for my middleware that gets the preferred locale:
In another middleware I use country code to determine the currency.
The Problem
But sometimes the user might only have a language code in the header and no country code- like  for English. You need the country to determine the currency. So what do you do?
In this case you either have to
guess the country based on language- easy for some languages, harder for others
get the client to request  and get the country code from the response
ask the client to specify their currency
I am going with either of the last two. But I'm having trouble figuring out when I do either of those.
What I could do if this was a route
If cookies were set by some route like  then this would be easy: the response could specify to the client what are the next steps. For example, the server could send a 200 status with a JSON object like . Then the client could know that more steps need to be taken.
But this is a general middleware
But cookies are typically not set in specific route requests. They are set on any first request made from that client to the server in middleware called on every request. This leaves me confused. We can detect in the middleware that there is no countryCode, but then what?
Solutions?
Do I hijack the request and send a response right from the middleware telling the frontend what to do? This seems complicated because we would have to have every fetch request on the front end set up to handle this response.
What are possible solutions to this?",65471353.0,1,2,,2020-12-25 22:46:20.033000+00:00,1.0,2020-12-29 16:16:34.333000+00:00,,,,,5004011.0,,1,1,node.js|rest|express|cookies|api-design,92

I want users who access this website anytime, to show them from where the animation stops not start the animation again.
This is not only restricted to animation but other event.
I do not have the best way to ask this question, so pardon me.
Let's say a website runs a countup from 1 to infinity.
Let anyone who visit the website see from where the countup count is, not starting the countup from 1 again.
I do not know how to go about this and will appreciate some help.
I know it has to do with real time.
I have also searched google but not getting exactly what i want probably due to the incorrect keywords.
I will be available to answer any follow up questions you have.
Examples can be made JS or another relatable framework
EDIT: Had to add this scenario to have a better understanding.
Let's say the website shows a live stream of a movie being recorded with a camera.(Event not initiated by the client or the server).
Users will always see the same thing and the current scene of that movie without storing any data of users.
I can't determine what triggers it as the animation in this instance should have no beginning and end.
Another example is seeing a Simulated virtual soccer site. Everyone sees the same state of the game even though its not played live and it keeps loading new events to be bet on.
EDIT2:
Like i said, i do not have the best way to ask this question. Thanks to Randy for bringing up the way the question should be.
Question: How do i stream a html5 animation that also shows the same state of anim to all users while it keeps looping.

65452289,Why is my GPU getting interrupted when training my data?,"I spent hours configuring my computer and finally got to make python train data on GPUs instead of CPU. However, for some reason my models keep getting interrupted halfway during the middle of their epochs and I cannot complete the training of the models.
Waiting for the computer does not solve this problem and I cannot interrupt the kernel either. I tried other people's solution and still don't have much luck.
I can train my model normally if I'm using a CPU (at a crawling rate), but when I switch to GPU my model trains really fast before they hang up half way, not completing all the epochs that are required. My python kernel also gets stuck on running after that and I cannot interrupt it unless I terminate the whole thing from task manager.
From my task manager performance history, during training there is a sustained spike at my GPU, which is expected. But when it hangs up my GPU activity goes back to 0, even though my kernel indicates that the training is still in the middle of its epoch. This happens randomly and is not dependent on the timing or the number of epochs, although it is more likely to happen the longer I train the data.
Here is my sequential model.
During training, I also get a warning message and I don't know what it means.

The images would have the following path: https://myserver.local/path/img1.jpg
The easiest way to make me self-signed cert work was to create a CA Root Cert and install it on simulator within Xcode and enable Full Trust. It's taken me half a day to configure the certs correctly, but in the end my code works when I start debugging in the simulator.
But during preview/live preview this results in this error:
An SSL error has occurred and a secure connection to the server cannot be made.
However all of the following are true:
I can access the image without SSL issue in Chrome, Safari on my macOS host (CA Cert is installed in System keychain and is trusted for all users; the web server has SSL cert signed by my CA Cert)
I can access the image without SSL error from Safari on the simulator (after CA Cert was installed and fully trusted)
As mentioned above I can access without SSL error the image when I run app in the debug mode in the simulator from Xcode.
If I choose an image on a website which has a third-party signed SSL cert then the image is displayed correctly in both simulator and preview pane.
This leads to me to believe that Xcode's Preview pane uses some other repository where I would need to put my CA Cert to make it work. If such an option exists at all.
I'm using iPhone 11 Pro Max as the preview scheme/simulator, iOS deployment target 14.3 is selected.

Also, are the stdin buffers of grep and cut line buffered as well? I couldn't find anything to confirm if this is true or not but if it isn't line buffered then what is the point of making the stdout buffer line buffered if the stdin on the other side is block buffered?
