RAM consumption: to display picture device must upload it to the memory. Some low end devices have 256MB of memory and to show 5248х3936 picture you will need to upload into memory ~82MB(5248px * 3936px * 32bit) - so most likely you will catch  exception.

The way forEvery (and other Inspectors too, I suspect) work is that they try to get your collection's iterator if they can, both to run the tests and to print out your collection. My solution passes the correct iterator only on the first run, and if the inspector tries to grab the iterator again (which it does only to print the collection out) it gets Seq.empty.iterator. The best thing which can be said about this code is that it works:
The inspector doesn't use either length or apply, so whatever I put there is irrelevant, as long as it has the correct type.

Virtual environments are probably slightly easier if you're just starting out but I would recommend building up to Docker, which is more complete IMO. If you're using Python 3 then you should use pyvenv to create your virtual environments. On Python 2 you want virtualenv.

SOLID means building many pieces that inject their dependencies so that every individual facet of your system is independently testable.

By using a base class, you are now providing an low-level implementation. Our intention with SOLID is to specifically not provide implementations until absolutely necessary.
For instance, take this example of an IConnectionFactory:

OracleConnectionFactory.cs

26215967,,"What you need to understand is what a SAN is. 
A SAN is one or more storage arrays, interconnected via a fiber channel network. Your host has special network cards - called Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) - for talking to that network. The network protocols are geared up for storage traffic, and so are well suited to high performance, low latency traffic.
The array you're talking to... well, it varies a great deal as to it's capability. Even an EMC SAN as you refer to it - might be a variety of EMC products as the storage array. Their primary purpose is consolidating storage performance. 
You get a better peak performance out of 100 spindles share with 10 servers, than you would if each server had 10 spindles each. So what your storage array is basically doing is carving up that chunk of 100 spindles into logical units - and then giving them back to your host, such that each host has about the same average performance, but it's peak is 10x the size. (Or more perhaps more realistically - they might go with 50 spindles, because then you get 5x the peak, but half the cost, in return for a lower average). 
Now - Filegroups. As I understand it (being a storage engineer, rather than knowing a great deal of SQL). Filegroups allow you to manage placement of data, specifically to the underlying storage. 
This is something of a ticklish point - because it depends. Typically your storage array will be doing some quite clever things of it's own in order to streamline data placement and throughput. Things like some quite aggressive caching - far more than you'd be getting on a normal host - meaning that a lot of your random access workload goes at 'RAM speed' rather than 'disk speed'. It may well be striping across a lot more spindles than you'd normally expect as well. 
Which as far as I can tell - is essentially what a filegroup is aiming to achieve - you manually place a file on a disk, and let SQL handle parallel IO to those disks. Your storage array is doing this for you already, and at best you'll make yourself unnecessary admin headache, and at worst you'll actually make array side optimization worse.
You probably do still want to segregate your various content types, but I would suggest you do so via different LUNs being allocated from your SAN. That's more so you can't drain space from one database by having another fill - but it also allows for a bit more flexibility when it comes to taking snapshots or clones. 
What I would suggest:
go talk to your storage guys about the expected IO profile of your database. (IO is what's expensive on a SAN, and typically databases use more of it than 'normal' applications)
put each instance on a different set of LUNs - separate out DB and logs and tempdb. 
Within vmware, you may end up with 'logical' disks on the same datastore. If performance is critical, it may be worth passing through the SAN LUNs direct to the host.
And then don't worry about it overly - if you notice a particular problem, it should be possible to retune/move individual LUNs around to improve the situation. ",,,0,,2014-10-06 12:10:21.687000+00:00,,2014-10-06 12:10:21.687000+00:00,,,,,2566198.0,25981656,2,2,,

Use table aliases for all your tables.  They make queries easier to read and write.
The table aliases should be abbreviations for the tables.
Avoid using reserved words for table and column names.

First off, the  and  are very important, obviously. Take a look at Apple's SpriteKit Physics Collisions sample code:
  // Contacts are often a double dispatch problem; the effect you want is based on the type of both bodies in the contact. This sample this in a brute force way, by checking the types of each. A more complicated example might use methods on objects to perform the type checking.
  
  // The contacts can appear in either order, and so normally you'd need to check
  each against the other. In this example, the category types are well ordered, so
  the code swaps the two bodies if they are out of order. This allows the code
  to only test collisions once.
What I did to solve it was setting a flag after handling each condition. In my case, I was testing whether  was nil in , because I called  on the missile/enemy nodes to destroy them.

Instead of building from the top-level directory, build from the output directory. You can access the source directories by setting the vpath. This option has the advantage that the built-in rules can be used.

The disadvantage is that error messages do not match the CWD. This can be solved by skipping  and directly building from the  directory.
Another advantage of this approach is that it's somewhat popular.  works in a similar fashion.

The following solution isn't nice in my opinion, as I really love the built-in rules. However, GNU make doesn't support something like  for output directories. And the built-in rules cannot match, as the  in  would match  of , leaving  with a search in  for stuff like , but not .

Besides, if  would only ever contain auto-gererated files, you could create it on-the-fly with an order-only prerequisite, making the clean rule slightly simpler:

26216150,,"I can envision two approaches:
a) You say that you cannot use classes ""as any combination of fields might be used"". But maybe composition (as opposed to inheritance) would do the job: a particle could have a DisplayBehavior, a MovementBehavior, etc. And those behaviors would hold the actual properties. Would this fit your problem? 
b) Otherwise, if the enumeration of all properties of a particle can be slow (a few microseconds) while the retrieval of the values of one or two specific properties must be fast, the proper solution is to have property stores: for each property you have one structure that holds the values of all particles. Basically you store the (particle-id, property-value) information, either in a flat array or a dictionary. This is the solution used by WPF for example and this is cache-efficient and memory-savvy.
Meanwhile you would store nothing in the Particle structure, to the point that you may consider removing this type and only store particle identifiers (possibly a ParticleID enum to make your code more explicit). Or you could keep this type and add properties that would manipulate the global property stores.
PS: one note about structs: do you understand them correctly? In most cases using a large struct is a bad idea because this involves many memory copies. The only case when this tax is not paid is when the struct can be accessed by its address, for example when you manipulate it through its index in an array (particles[index].Position = ...).",,,1,,2014-10-06 12:22:15.360000+00:00,,2014-10-06 12:27:18.367000+00:00,2014-10-06 12:27:18.367000+00:00,,3998057.0,,3998057.0,26214938,2,1,,

 (NLP) : processing text data and 
 (where the classification models are built)
First I would suggesting going through NLP tutorials and then text classification tutorials, the most appropriate being https://class.coursera.org/nlp/lecture 
If you're looking for libraries available in  or , take a look at Java or Python for Natural Language Processing
If you're new to text processing, please take a look at the  library that provides a nice introduction to doing NLP, see http://www.nltk.org/book/ch01.html
Now to the hard core details:
First, ask yourself whether you have twitter/facebook comments (let's call them documents from now on) that are manually labelled with the categories you want. 
1a. If YES, look at supervised machine learning, see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html
1b. If NO, look at UNsupervised machine learning, i suggest clustering and topic modelling, http://radimrehurek.com/gensim/
After knowing which kind of machine learning you need, split the documents up into at least training (70-90%) and testing (10-30%) set, see 
Note. I suggest at least because there are other ways to split up your documents, e.g. for development or cross-validation. (if you don't understand this, it's all right, just follow step 2)
Finally, Train and Test your model
3a. If supervised, use the training set to train your supervised model. Apply your model onto the test set and then see how well you performed.
3b. If unsupervised, use the training set to generate documents clusters (that means to group similar documents) but they still have no labels. So you need to think of some smart way to label the groups of documents correctly. (To this date, there is no real good solution to this, even super effective neural networks cannot know what the neurons are firing, they just know each neuron is firing something specific)",,,2,,2014-10-06 12:25:43.017000+00:00,,2014-10-06 17:25:55.387000+00:00,2017-05-23 11:55:07.183000+00:00,,-1.0,,610569.0,26213496,2,2,,

  &lt;http://example.org/aabbc> rdfs:label ""Tree""@eng
Although I havent't found a description of the yago:means relationship, it seems that it is meant to link together resources that mean the same thing. In YAGO, they exploit this relationship to link resources (from http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1819115:2/component/escidoc:1840732/MPI-I-2006-5-006.pdf): 
  ""if the user typed ”Einstein, Albert” instead of ”Albert Einstein”,
  then there is a virtual redirect page for ”Einstein, Albert” that
  links to ”Albert Einstein”. We exploit the redirect pages to give us
  alternative names for the entities. For each redirect, we introduce a
  corresponding means fact (e.g. (”Einstein, Albert”, means, Albert
  Einstein)).""
What this means is that they create two different entities, with their respective URIs (one for ""Albert Einstein"" and another for ""Einstein, Albert""), and they link it through the ""means"" property. They are not linking the literals directly, as you can't use a literal as a domain for a property. 
Therefore, if you want to create links between your resources and Yago you could do so by:
Show the yago's link directly (If you show html in your pages) 
Use your document URI as the domain and state something like ""refersTo"" or ""linksTo"" the Yago entity (if you want to just link your document as a whole to Yago) :
  yourDocURI yourdomain:refersTo yagoEntityFound
Create a URI for the word and specify the equivalent individual with and owl:sameAs link (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def) (If you want to state that some words of your document link to yago's resources):
  http://example.org/wordPage owl:sameAs yagoEntityLarryPage
2) Yago is a huge ontology and navigating it might be tricky. However I found this: https://gate.d5.mpi-inf.mpg.de/webyagospotlx/Browser which might do the trick. I hope it helps. Also, YAGO uses the wordnet definitions, so it might help you to take a look there.
