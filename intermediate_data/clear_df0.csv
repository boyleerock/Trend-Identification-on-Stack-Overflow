Senselessness: it's just senseless to show 1200x1920 picture on a device with 320x640 screen because user will not see the difference. Of course in case you don't need to have zoom functionality.
Network traffic: contemporary camera modules could capture tremendously large pictures (5248 х 3936 pixels). To download such a large file user will be waiting for a quite long time.
RAM consumption: to display picture device must upload it to the memory. Some low end devices have 256MB of memory and to show 5248х3936 picture you will need to upload into memory ~82MB(5248px * 3936px * 32bit) - so most likely you will catch  exception.

The way forEvery (and other Inspectors too, I suspect) work is that they try to get your collection's iterator if they can, both to run the tests and to print out your collection. My solution passes the correct iterator only on the first run, and if the inspector tries to grab the iterator again (which it does only to print the collection out) it gets Seq.empty.iterator. The best thing which can be said about this code is that it works:
The inspector doesn't use either length or apply, so whatever I put there is irrelevant, as long as it has the correct type. Extending Seq is just about the easiest way I have found to pretend to be a GenTraversable (which is needed to have my own class' iterator used).

You can place the Cursor Image on your XImage by using the fields x,y on the XFixesCursorImage, but remember that the pixel format of the XImage might differ from that of the XFixesCursorImage, which is always 32 bits per pixel ARGB. 
Said that, please note that unsigned long can actually be 64 bits if compiling for x86_64, so your conversions should use unsigned long to be portable and not assume it will be 32 bits.
Placing example (with funcs missing but good enough for the explanation):
Notes: img in the code is the XFixesCursorImage, and do not trust the field 'cursor_serial' in order to determine if cursors are different of each other, because sometimes this field is just 0. Not sure why."

If  works, then you were able to decode the file using the default system encoding. See the  function documentation:
  encoding is the name of the encoding used to decode or encode the file. This should only be used in text mode. The default encoding is platform dependent (whatever  returns), but any encoding supported by Python can be used. 
That is not to say that you were reading the file using the correct encoding; that just means that the default encoding didn't break (encountered bytes for which it doesn't have a character mapping). It could still be mapping those bytes to the wrong characters.

If you're using Python 3 then you should use pyvenv to create your virtual environments. On Python 2 you want virtualenv.

1.0,2014-10-06 12:10:16.433000+00:00,"The intention of SOLID is to get you to create a system that is implementation independent.
SOLID means building many pieces that inject their dependencies so that every individual facet of your system is independently testable. You have an IDbConnectionService that provides an implementation contract to your project. When writing test cases for a service that uses IDbConnectionService as a dependency, you can mock out the functionality of IDbConnectionService to return what you need it to in a faked run time environment. 
By using a base class, you are now providing an low-level implementation. Our intention with SOLID is to specifically not provide implementations until absolutely necessary.
For instance, take this example of an IConnectionFactory:
IConnectionFactory.cs
SqlConnectionFactory.cs
OracleConnectionFactory.cs
SqlConnection and OracleConnection have one reason to change, but the interface segregation principal only requires one contract for them to fulfill in order to stand in for the concept of a ConnectionFactory."
2.0,2014-10-06 12:10:21.687000+00:00,"What you need to understand is what a SAN is. 
A SAN is one or more storage arrays, interconnected via a fiber channel network. Your host has special network cards - called Host Bus Adapters (HBAs) - for talking to that network. The network protocols are geared up for storage traffic, and so are well suited to high performance, low latency traffic.
The array you're talking to... well, it varies a great deal as to it's capability. Even an EMC SAN as you refer to it - might be a variety of EMC products as the storage array. Their primary purpose is consolidating storage performance. 
You get a better peak performance out of 100 spindles share with 10 servers, than you would if each server had 10 spindles each. So what your storage array is basically doing is carving up that chunk of 100 spindles into logical units - and then giving them back to your host, such that each host has about the same average performance, but it's peak is 10x the size. (Or more perhaps more realistically - they might go with 50 spindles, because then you get 5x the peak, but half the cost, in return for a lower average). 
Now - Filegroups. As I understand it (being a storage engineer, rather than knowing a great deal of SQL). Filegroups allow you to manage placement of data, specifically to the underlying storage. 
This is something of a ticklish point - because it depends. Typically your storage array will be doing some quite clever things of it's own in order to streamline data placement and throughput. Things like some quite aggressive caching - far more than you'd be getting on a normal host - meaning that a lot of your random access workload goes at 'RAM speed' rather than 'disk speed'. It may well be striping across a lot more spindles than you'd normally expect as well. 
Which as far as I can tell - is essentially what a filegroup is aiming to achieve - you manually place a file on a disk, and let SQL handle parallel IO to those disks. Your storage array is doing this for you already, and at best you'll make yourself unnecessary admin headache, and at worst you'll actually make array side optimization worse.
You probably do still want to segregate your various content types, but I would suggest you do so via different LUNs being allocated from your SAN. That's more so you can't drain space from one database by having another fill - but it also allows for a bit more flexibility when it comes to taking snapshots or clones. 
What I would suggest:
go talk to your storage guys about the expected IO profile of your database. (IO is what's expensive on a SAN, and typically databases use more of it than 'normal' applications)
put each instance on a different set of LUNs - separate out DB and logs and tempdb. 
Within vmware, you may end up with 'logical' disks on the same datastore. If performance is critical, it may be worth passing through the SAN LUNs direct to the host.
And then don't worry about it overly - if you notice a particular problem, it should be possible to retune/move individual LUNs around to improve the situation. "

(In whatever happens to be the current working directory for the browser process, since no directory was specified.)

I would recommend writing your query as:
Note:  this also fixes the problem that you seem to want to join to  and not a self-join to .
And some advice:
Use table aliases for all your tables.  They make queries easier to read and write.
The table aliases should be abbreviations for the tables.
Avoid using reserved words for table and column names.
Avoid square braces (unless you really need them); they make queries harder to write and to read.
In addition, I usually give my tables names in the plural () with a primary key in the singular (), and then always try to have foreign keys have the same name ( in both cases)."

0.0,2014-10-14 06:46:26.857000+00:00,"Yeah thats correct, i've accepted it as answer.
the problem with calculating a weight per pixel (treat every pixel as a box with volume), is that even when you're standing still, the amount of pixels differs alot. if i can somehow reduce that, i can get a pretty good estimate weight, but it will never be 100% or even 90% accurate."
0.0,2014-10-06 13:50:37.253000+00:00,"Thanks for the reply. Separating the body into shapes seems difficult in the first place. For now i'm trying to calculate distance from the corresponding Joint to the actual z-depth of the pixel. Then i should try to add up all the values of each pixel and determine a 'weight' per pixel-depth, and add it all together."
0.0,2014-10-10 04:34:51.953000+00:00,now how you are going to calculate the weight per pixel I dont think it is possible at all with Kinect. This is a far more practical solution which you can even accept as the answer.
