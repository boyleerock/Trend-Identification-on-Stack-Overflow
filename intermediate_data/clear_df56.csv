All of that aside, the error that your seeing looks like a problem with the Same Origin policy.

Honestly, though, it seems like you have a lot of issues that you're dealing with (cross domain issues, jQuery being undefined, cross-browser compatibility). You should probably try and simplify your code to see if it works in simple cases. Rather than storing all Javascript variables in a cookie, see if you can just store a simple string value in a cookie and see if your code is cross-browser compatible.

3.0,2011-02-19 06:02:33.360000+00:00,"Nonblocking servers are the best choice provided all your libraries provides nonblocking apis. As mentioned in  your second question if a library blocks (eg database lib making a blocking call), the entire process/thread blocks and the system hangs. Not all of the libraries available are asynchronous which makes it difficult to use tornado/eventlet for all usecases. Also in a multi-core box multiple instances of nonblocking servers needs to be started to use the box capacity completly.
Tornado/Event servers are similar to java nio based servers. There is one conceptual difference between a Tornado and Eventlet. Tornado follows a reactor pattern where the single process waits for IO(socket) events and dispatches them to appropriate handlers. If handlers are nonblocking, best performance can be expected. Typically code written for these frameworks consists of a series of callbacks making it a bit less readable than a synchronous server .Java NIO servers comes under this category.
Eventlet performs the same task but with a cleaner interface. Code can be written as in the case of synchronous server without using callbacks. When an IO is encountered, eventlet schedules another userspace process(not right terminology). 
Apache webapps are more popular that these because of few reasons
It is relatively easy to write synchronous code
Not all required libraries are asynchronous.
But for writing a chat application which handles lots of connections a multi-threaded server will not scale. You have to use async frameworks like twisted/event/Java NIO."

Save using a .mat file, but for each variable you want to save you would need to load any variables with the same name from the .mat file, combine old variable with the new variable and then resave it to the file.

4.0,2011-06-25 16:03:01.403000+00:00,"Reduce variable sizes (in embedded systems)
If your variable size is larger than the word size on a specific architecture, it can have a significant effect on both code size and speed. For example, if you have a 16 bit system, and use a  variable very often, and later realize that it can never get outside the range (−32.768 ... 32.767) consider reducing it to 
From my personal experience, if a program is ready or almost ready, but we realize it takes up about 110% or 120% of the target hardware's program memory, a quick normalization of variables usually solves the problem more often than not. 
By this time, optimizing the algorithms or parts of the code itself can become frustratingly futile: 
reorganize the whole structure and the program no longer works as intended, or at least you introduce a lot of bugs.
do some clever tricks: usually you spend a lot of time optimizing something, and discover no or very small decrease in code size, as the compiler would have optimized it anyway.
Many people make the mistake of having variables which exactly store the numerical value of a unit they use the variable for: for example, their variable  stores the exact number of milliseconds, even if only time steps of say 50 ms are relevant. Maybe if your variable represented 50 ms for each increment of one, you would be able to fit into a variable smaller or equal to the word size. On an 8 bit system, for example, even a simple addition of two 32-bit variables generates a fair amount of code, especially if you are low on registers, while 8 bit additions are both small and fast."

Here is the same question on SO.
Edit: To address your header alternative question
As far as I understood you're searching for an alternative approach for header redirects. Well typically PHP Frameworks I know use some Bootstrapping mechanisms to build the user output. Take a look at my rude graphic below:
Essentially the request from the client will always be handled via a main entry point (index.php) where you depending on the url style either use hashes, or parts of the querystring to determine where to navigate to. Thats the job of the bootstrapper to find out: ""Ok the user want's to visit Page XYZ"".
The next layer could be the Authorization amongst others. Here you would check whether the user has the permission or not if so continue to your BL and render the result which then is returned to the client.
So this whole sequence takes place during the initial request from the client thus no redirecting would be needed. For detailed examples take a look how well-known Frameworks do the Job."
