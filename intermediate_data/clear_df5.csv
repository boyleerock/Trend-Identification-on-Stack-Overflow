The basics of my problem is that whenenver I press a button, it will grab the file I select and save it to a text file. This works fine and I can save as many files as needed. The problem lies in the listbox of my listbox. My app is a soundboard, and I want filenames with their hotkeys to be displayed on the listbox which almost works fine. On loading the application the listbox will take all saved files and display them accordingly once and on adding a file, the file will be added to the listbox and it will be saved.

1.0,2020-10-05 18:21:01.550000+00:00,"Overview: I have a GUI-based program that has a multitude of functionality built into buttons and menu selection items. Many of the processes are instantaneous, but several of them can easily take more than 5, 10 or even 20 seconds.
Current Problem: While I have a dialog box displaying, it will not display the text inside of the box, such as 'Completing Process, please wait...'
Goal: While a long processes run, I would like to display a 'please wait' dialog box, so that the user knows the program is not stalled and is working on the function the user selected.
Background info: The GUI is built in PySide2 (aka PyQt5) and Python 3.6.5
Current Attempts:
Method 1 - Initially, I used the  module to initiate the primary function to be run. At the start of the function, I would have a call to show the dialog box, which would display as intended and the rest of the function would process/complete in the background.
Method 1 Problem - This worked great until the program became more complex and I needed to use ThreadPoolExecutor to speed up things. ThreadPoolExecutor and the threading module do not work well, if at all together and will result in a crash without an error message, so I had to abandon that method.
Method 2 - I tried using the  function of the QDialog box and called the  function
Method 2 Problem - The dialog box would show and display the text as desired, but setModal(False) had no effect and the processes would be halted until the window was closed.
Method 3 (current method used) - In the initialization of my ProcessRunning dialog window class, I have created a PySide2 signal, which takes in a string (the string being the message that I want to display). The preceeding line before a call to a long process, I called the  function of my signal, connected to which is the function to display the dialog box.
Method 3 Problem - The window displays and the background process runs but the window doesn't display the text, almost like that part of the process is held up by the background process.
Summary: While the question title suggests I don't know how to display a QDialog box, the real problem is displaying the text inside the window which instructs the user to &quot;wait.&quot; I feel that since this isn't happening with my current method, I am not displaying the box &quot;correctly&quot;. So, the &quot;correct&quot; method to achieve this is what I am in search of.

On the other hand,  is called millions of times.
I want to check for collisions between the supplied segment and the rest of the segments added in the priority queue from the csv file
I do not want to be adding elements to the priority queue from scratch each time. This would not be feasible.
TL;DR
The problem I am having is that after the first call of  the priority queue has changed since  works by polling elements from the queue, thus altering the queue.
How do I keep the priority queue created by algoObj.addSegments() from changing between function calls?
Does this have to do witch shallow and deep copying as explained here?
I tried creating a copy of the queue at the beginning of the function and then altering the copy:
This however does not work as it still alters the priority queue of the original .

Here's the code:"
1.0,2020-10-13 18:28:37.037000+00:00,"Setup:
I have a RPi 4 with miniDLNA (ReadyMedia) and samba each running in a docker, a SSD connected via USB3 to the RPi and a TV connected via WiFi. All devices are in my locale network. The SSD is formatted as ext4. I have access via samba to a folder on my SSD which also functions as the miniDLNA volume.
I have transfer speeds of around 90MB/s via LAN and WiFi to my samba share. But the issue is when streaming videos via miniDLNA I notice long buffering times and it usually gets stuck after watching for just a few seconds (both on TV [WiFi] as well as on a Win10 machine [LAN]). Until now, I didn't notice this behaviour with .mp4 files, only with .mkv files. The video files are 1080p.
The two docker files I use are from dperson/samba and ypopovych/readymedia, respectively.
I do not think this is an issue with my docker-compose file, rather than  an encoding issue, but nevertheless here is my docker-compose file:
Does anybody have some pointers or experienced similar behaviours?
Edit:
After some further testing I can rule out miniDLNA and samba. I created a share on the SD-card on my RPi and played a mkv video from there. No buffering problems at all. As soon as I play it from my SSD connected via USB3, I get the buffering problems every few seconds. When that happens the SSD does not respond at all for a couple of seconds. This is strange, because reading and writing from the SSD works with constant 90-100MB/s via network."

Seems pretty straightforward. It asynchronously loads an external script, which does add something to the page, but it doesn't remove anything, and it doesn't mess with any event handlers. In my index.js, I use the Button component I've created, which looks like this:
Again, pretty simple. But after a few hours of scratching my head figuring out why that callback function wasn't firing, I figured it out: when I removed the external js script from the _app.js file, the Button's onClick works. When the external js script is in, the Button's onClick doesn't work. Nothing in the external file messes with the Button or with event handlers. It does add a DOM element to the page (it's a non-React library), so I'm thinking that React is rerendering the page client side once the script finishes loading, and when it rerenders, it does so without the onClick event handler on the Button component. I'm not sure why it would do this though, and how I could get around it. I'm typically leery of workarounds since the developers of React probably put that there for a reason, but I'm not quite sure what I'm supposed to do.
Am I correct to assume that React is rendering this page twice because of the external script in ?
If so, what is the reasoning for this? What benefit is there to me not hacking my way around this?
How can I load that external script without making React rerender completely unrelated components?
That third question is the kicker. Thanks in advance."

What I did not know is that it's normal to dereference a null pointer. I thought that any dereferencing for a null pointer would result in an exception.
After playing with pointers for a bit, I concluded that dereferencing a null pointer itself is not the problem, the problem is trying to read or write to the address pointed to by the null pointer.
And since the functions are in a well known location in memory, dereferencing a null pointer to a class and calling one of its functions will just result in calling the function with the null object as the first parameter.
That was new to me, but that's probably not the complete picture.
I thought at first that this was an OOP concept at first, thus it should work in java for example, but it didn't work here and caused an exception (which makes me think why it doesn't work in java?...):
So, clearly this is something related to C++ and not OOP in general.
What are all of the situations under which dereferencing a null pointer will be valid and won't cause exceptions?
Is there something else other than pointers of structs and classes that can be dereferenced successfully even if they're null pointers?
Also, why is calling a function of a null pointer without accessing its fields raises an exception in other languages like java?
One case where dereferencing a null pointer makes sense is in Red-Black trees for example. Null pointers are considered to be black.
Here, I believe it makes more sense to include the function in the  class itself since it's related to it. It's not very convenient to include all of the logic related to the node inside it except for the one that checks for it being null."
