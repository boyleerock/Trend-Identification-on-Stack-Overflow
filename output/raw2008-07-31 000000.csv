Also, given that `smp_read_barrier_depends()` in the Linux kernel is only a barrier for Alpha, it seems that if there is a (possibly fake) address dependency on the reading side, the read barrier can be avoided (save for Alpha).

I don't think the problem lies in the conversion performed by `wcout`. I'd check two things. First, whether the string literal makes its way into the binary intact. Do `wcout << (int)L'П';` - this should print `1055`; if it doesn't, the character is mangled by the compiler. Second, whether the console is set up to display non-English characters. Redirect output to a file, examine it with hex viewer. Cyrillic `'П'` should be represented as two bytes `D0 9F`",2

Furthermore, you also have a string data member in addition to the private inheritance.  That's wasteful.  Just write a wrapper around it with your added functionality.",1
