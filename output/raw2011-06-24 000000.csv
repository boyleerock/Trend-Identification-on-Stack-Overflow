51,10057671,"<p>Let me prefix this by saying that I know what <code>foreach</code> is, does and how to use it. This question concerns how it works under the bonnet, and I don't want any answers along the lines of ""this is how you loop an array with <code>foreach</code>"".</p>

<hr>

<p>For a long time I assumed that <code>foreach</code> worked with the array itself. Then I found many references to the fact that it works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, and I have since assumed this to be the end of the story. But I recently got into a discussion on the matter, and after a little experimentation found that this was not in fact 100% true.</p>

<p>Let me show what I mean. For the following test cases, we will be working with the following array:</p>

<pre><code>$array = array(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 1</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  $array[] = $item;
}
print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 2 3 4 5 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>This clearly shows that we are not working directly with the source array - otherwise the loop would continue forever, since we are constantly pushing items onto the array during the loop. But just to be sure this is the case:</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/nirz6Ufh"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 2</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  $array[$key + 1] = $item + 2;
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

print_r($array);

/* Output in loop:    1 2 3 4 5
   $array after loop: 1 3 4 5 6 7 */
</code></pre>

<p>This backs up our initial conclusion, we are working with a copy of the source array during the loop, otherwise we would see the modified values during the loop. <em>But...</em></p>

<p>If we look in the <a href=""http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.foreach.php"" rel=""noreferrer"">manual</a>, we find this statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When foreach first starts executing, the internal array pointer is automatically reset to the first element of the array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Right... this seems to suggest that <code>foreach</code> relies on the array pointer of the source array. But we've just proved that we're <em>not working with the source array</em>, right? Well, not entirely.</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/6n20ooMy"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 3</a>:</p>

<pre><code>// Move the array pointer on one to make sure it doesn't affect the loop
var_dump(each($array));

foreach ($array as $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
}

var_dump(each($array));

/* Output
  array(4) {
    [1]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [""value""]=&gt;
    int(1)
    [0]=&gt;
    int(0)
    [""key""]=&gt;
    int(0)
  }
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  bool(false)
*/
</code></pre>

<p>So, despite the fact that we are not working directly with the source array, we are working directly with the source array pointer - the fact that the pointer is at the end of the array at the end of the loop shows this. Except this can't be true - if it was, then <a href=""http://codepad.org/7DIeObk9"" rel=""noreferrer"">test case 1</a> would loop forever.</p>

<p>The PHP manual also states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As foreach relies on the internal array pointer changing it within the loop may lead to unexpected behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, let's find out what that ""unexpected behavior"" is (technically, any behavior is unexpected since I no longer know what to expect).</p>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/JJp79xSd"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 4</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  each($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p><a href=""http://codepad.org/IfwJyTCL"" rel=""noreferrer"">Test case 5</a>:</p>

<pre><code>foreach ($array as $key =&gt; $item) {
  echo ""$item\n"";
  reset($array);
}

/* Output: 1 2 3 4 5 */
</code></pre>

<p>...nothing that unexpected there, in fact it seems to support the ""copy of source"" theory.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>The Question</strong></p>

<p>What is going on here? My C-fu is not good enough for me to able to extract a proper conclusion simply by looking at the PHP source code, I would appreciate it if someone could translate it into English for me.</p>

<p>It seems to me that <code>foreach</code> works with a <em>copy</em> of the array, but sets the array pointer of the source array to the end of the array after the loop.</p>

<li>Is this correct and the whole story?</li>
<li>If not, what is it really doing?</li>

57,35062852,"<p>I'm trying to summarize my knowledge about the most popular JavaScript package managers, bundlers, and task runners. Please correct me if I'm wrong:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>npm</code> &amp; <code>bower</code> are package managers. They just download the dependencies and don't know how to build projects on their own. What they know is to call <code>webpack</code>/<code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> after fetching all the dependencies.</li>
<li><code>bower</code> is like <code>npm</code>, but builds a flattened dependency trees (unlike <code>npm</code> which does it recursively). Meaning <code>npm</code> fetches the dependencies for each dependency (may fetch the same a few times), while <code>bower</code> expects you to manually include sub-dependencies. Sometimes <code>bower</code> and <code>npm</code> are used together for front-end and back-end respectively (since each megabyte might matter in front-end).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> and <code>gulp</code> are task runners to automate everything that can be automated (i.e. compile CSS/Sass, optimize images, make a bundle and minify/transpile it).</li>
<li><code>grunt</code> vs. <code>gulp</code> (is like <code>maven</code> vs. <code>gradle</code> or configuration vs. code). Grunt is based on configuring separate independent tasks, each task opens/handles/closes file. Gulp requires less amount of code and is based on Node streams, which allows it to build pipe chains (w/o reopening the same file) and makes it faster. </li>
<li><code>webpack</code> (<code>webpack-dev-server</code>) - for me it's a task runner with hot reloading of changes which allows you to forget about all JS/CSS watchers. </li>
<li><code>npm</code>/<code>bower</code> + plugins may replace task runners. Their abilities often intersect so there are different implications if you need to use <code>gulp</code>/<code>grunt</code> over <code>npm</code> + plugins. But task runners are definitely better for complex tasks (e.g. ""on each build create bundle, transpile from ES6 to ES5, run it at all browsers emulators, make screenshots and deploy to dropbox through ftp"").</li>
<li><code>browserify</code> allows packaging node modules for browsers. <code>browserify</code> vs <code>node</code>'s <code>require</code> is actually <a href=""https://addyosmani.com/writing-modular-js/"" rel=""noreferrer"">AMD vs CommonJS</a>.</li>

58,22342854,"<p>I have recently stumbled upon the game <a href=""http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/"" rel=""noreferrer"">2048</a>. You merge similar tiles by moving them in any of the four directions to make ""bigger"" tiles. After each move, a new tile appears at random empty position with a value of either <code>2</code> or <code>4</code>. The game terminates when all the boxes are filled and there are no moves that can merge tiles, or you create a tile with a value of <code>2048</code>.</p>

<p>One, I need to follow a well-defined strategy to reach the goal. So, I thought of writing a program for it.</p>

<p>My current algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>while (!game_over) {
    for each possible move:
        count_no_of_merges_for_2-tiles and 4-tiles
    choose the move with a large number of merges
}
</code></pre>

<p>What I am doing is at any point, I will try to merge the tiles with values <code>2</code> and <code>4</code>, that is, I try to have <code>2</code> and <code>4</code> tiles, as minimum as possible. If I try it this way, all other tiles were automatically getting merged and the strategy seems good.</p>

<p>But, when I actually use this algorithm, I only get around 4000 points before the game terminates. Maximum points AFAIK is slightly more than 20,000 points which is way larger than my current score. Is there a better algorithm than the above?</p>",What is the optimal algorithm for the game 2048?,What is the optimal algorithm for the game 2048?

76,10168686,"<p>One of the most interesting projects I've worked on in the past couple of years was a project about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_processing"" rel=""noreferrer"">image processing</a>. The goal was to develop a system to be able to recognize Coca-Cola <strong>'cans'</strong> (note that I'm stressing the word 'cans', you'll see why in a minute). You can see a sample below, with the can recognized in the <em>green rectangle</em> with scale and rotation.</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/irQtR.png"" alt=""Template matching""></p>

<p>Some constraints on the project:</p>

<ul>
<li>The background could be very noisy.</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could have any <em>scale</em> or <em>rotation</em> or even orientation (within reasonable limits).</li>
<li>The image could have some degree of fuzziness (contours might not be entirely straight).</li>
<li>There could be Coca-Cola bottles in the image, and the algorithm should only detect the <em>can</em>!</li>
<li>The brightness of the image could vary a lot (so you can't rely ""too much"" on color detection).</li>
<li>The <em>can</em> could be partly hidden on the sides or the middle and possibly partly hidden behind a bottle.</li>
<li>There could be no <em>can</em> at all in the image, in which case you had to find nothing and write a message saying so.</li>
</ul>

<p>So you could end up with tricky things like this (which in this case had my algorithm totally fail):</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/Byw82.png"" alt=""Total fail""></p>

<p>I did this project a while ago, and had a lot of fun doing it, and I had a decent implementation. Here are some details about my implementation:</p>

<p><strong>Language</strong>: Done in C++ using <a href=""http://opencv.org"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenCV</a> library.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-processing</strong>: For the image pre-processing, i.e. transforming the image into a more raw form to give to the algorithm, I used 2 methods:</p>

<ol>
<li>Changing color domain from RGB to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV"" rel=""noreferrer"">HSV</a> and filtering based on ""red"" hue, saturation above a certain threshold to avoid orange-like colors, and filtering of low value to avoid dark tones. The end result was a binary black and white image, where all white pixels would represent the pixels that match this threshold. Obviously there is still a lot of crap in the image, but this reduces the number of dimensions you have to work with.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/ktdAB.png"" alt=""Binarized image"">  </li>
<li>Noise filtering using median filtering (taking the median pixel value of all neighbors and replace the pixel by this value) to reduce noise.</li>
<li>Using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector"" rel=""noreferrer"">Canny Edge Detection Filter</a> to get the contours of all items after 2 precedent steps.
<img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/F9319.png"" alt=""Contour detection""></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Algorithm</strong>: The algorithm itself I chose for this task was taken from <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0123725380"" rel=""noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> awesome book on feature extraction and called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalised_Hough_transform"" rel=""noreferrer"">Generalized Hough Transform</a> (pretty different from the regular Hough Transform). It basically says a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>You can describe an object in space without knowing its analytical equation (which is the case here).</li>
<li>It is resistant to image deformations such as scaling and rotation, as it will basically test your image for every combination of scale factor and rotation factor.</li>
<li>It uses a base model (a template) that the algorithm will ""learn"".</li>
<li>Each pixel remaining in the contour image will vote for another pixel which will supposedly be the center (in terms of gravity) of your object, based on what it learned from the model.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the end, you end up with a heat map of the votes, for example here all the pixels of the contour of the can will vote for its gravitational center, so you'll have a lot of votes in the same pixel corresponding to the center, and will see a peak in the heat map as below:</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/wxrT1.png"" alt=""GHT""></p>

<p>Once you have that, a simple threshold-based heuristic can give you the location of the center pixel, from which you can derive the scale and rotation and then plot your little rectangle around it (final scale and rotation factor will obviously be relative to your original template). In theory at least...</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong>: Now, while this approach worked in the basic cases, it was severely lacking in some areas:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is <strong>extremely slow</strong>! I'm not stressing this enough. Almost a full day was needed to process the 30 test images, obviously because I had a very high scaling factor for rotation and translation, since some of the cans were very small.</li>
<li>It was completely lost when bottles were in the image, and for some reason almost always found the bottle instead of the can (perhaps because bottles were bigger, thus had more pixels, thus more votes)</li>
<li>Fuzzy images were also no good, since the votes ended up in pixel at random locations around the center, thus ending with a very noisy heat map.</li>
<li>In-variance in translation and rotation was achieved, but not in orientation, meaning that a can that was not directly facing the camera objective wasn't recognized.</li>
</ul>

<p>Can you help me improve my <strong>specific</strong> algorithm, using <strong>exclusively OpenCV</strong> features, to resolve the <strong>four specific</strong> issues mentioned?</p>

<p>I hope some people will also learn something out of it as well, after all I think not only people who ask questions should learn. :)</p>",Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition,Image Processing: Algorithm Improvement for 'Coca-Cola Can' Recognition
77,8898925,"<p>When using lambda expressions or anonymous methods in C#, we have to be wary of the <em>access to modified closure</em> pitfall. For example:</p>

<pre><code>foreach (var s in strings)
{
   query = query.Where(i =&gt; i.Prop == s); // access to modified closure
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Due to the modified closure, the above code will cause all of the <code>Where</code> clauses on the query to be based on the final value of <code>s</code>.</p>

<p>As explained <a href=""http://resnikb.wordpress.com/2009/06/17/c-lambda-and-foreach-variable/"" rel=""noreferrer"">here</a>, this happens because the <code>s</code> variable declared in <code>foreach</code> loop above is translated like this in the compiler:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>instead of like this:</p>

<pre><code>while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   string s;
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
</code></pre>

<p>As pointed out <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2388644/120955"">here</a>, there are no performance advantages to declaring a variable outside the loop, and under normal circumstances the only reason I can think of for doing this is if you plan to use the variable outside the scope of the loop:</p>

<pre><code>string s;
while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
   s = enumerator.Current;
   ...
}
var finalString = s;
</code></pre>

<p>However variables defined in a <code>foreach</code> loop cannot be used outside the loop:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(string s in strings)
{
}
var finalString = s; // won't work: you're outside the scope.
</code></pre>

<p>So the compiler declares the variable in a way that makes it highly prone to an error that is often difficult to find and debug, while producing no perceivable benefits.</p>

<p>Is there something you can do with <code>foreach</code> loops this way that you couldn't if they were compiled with an inner-scoped variable, or is this just an arbitrary choice that was made before anonymous methods and lambda expressions were available or common, and which hasn't been revised since then?</p>",Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?,Is there a reason for C#'s reuse of the variable in a foreach?
