<p>2) Ensure you overwrote the <em>toString()</em>-method in Level, so that the level returns its representation in a String similar to the one used in the constructor:</p>

<p>From my (somewhat limited knowledge) of the ""under-the-hood"" working of a SQL Connection, many steps are involved, such as:</p>

<p><strong>The Steps Under the Hood</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Physical socket/pipe is opened (using given drivers, eg ODBC)</li>
<li>Handshake with SQL Server</li>
<li>Connection string/credentials negotiated</li>
<li>Transaction scoping</li>
</ol>

<p>Not to mention connection pooling, i believe there is some kind of alogrithm involved (if the connection string matches one for an already existing pool, the connection is added to the pool, otherwise new one is created)</p>

<p><strong>IDiposable</strong></p>

<p>With regards to SQL Connections, we implement IDisposable so that when we call dispose (either via the using directive, or explicity), it places the connection back into the connection pool. This is in stark contrast with just the plain old sqlConnection.Close() - as all this does is close it temporarily, but reserves that connection for later use.</p>

<p>From my understanding, .Close() closes the connection to the database, whereas .Dispose() calls .Close(), and <strong>then</strong> releases unmanaged resources.</p>

<p>Those points in mind, at the very least it is good practice to implement IDisposable.</p>"

<pre><code>OTHER_CFLAGS[sdk=iphoneos*] = foobar
OTHER_CFLAGS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = barfoo
</code></pre>

<p>Any build setting can be conditional on a number of things, for example the shortname for an sdk. The device SDKs are named iphoneos-4.0 for example, and sim iphonesimulator-4.0. The above thus gets you the 'foobar' as CFLAG for the device, and 'barfoo' for the sim.</p>

<p>To get started with xcconfigs quickly: </p>

<ol>
<li>New file > Other > Configuration Settings File</li>
<li>Open the project or target editor (cmd-alt-E for the target one)</li>
<li>Select a setting you want to customize (like cflags), and copy it with cmd-c</li>
<li>Paste in the new xcconfig file</li>
<li>Modify as above</li>
<li>In your project or target editor's lower right corner, select your xcconfig file as ""Based On"". </li>
</ol>

<p>Notice how the build settings UI now lets you edit the conditionals... You can create new conditionals with the lower left button, but it won't let you set ""iphoneos*"" for example, only specific versions.</p>

<p>Note that the magical $(inherited) lets you make a setting that inherits project settings but overrides just a part of it, like so:</p>

<pre><code>OTHER_CFLAGS[sdk=iphoneos*] = $(inherited) foobar
OTHER_CFLAGS[sdk=iphonesimulator*] = $(inherited) barfoo
</code></pre>

Python is extremely powerful, but relies heavily on good coding conventions and practices to keep code maintainable.  In particular, it does not enforce type safety or insulation, which means it is easy to abuse.  C# is a modern object oriented language, with strong typing and other features to help enforce insulation and encapsulation.  It's not as wildly flexible, but I've also found that larger C# programs are much easier to maintain (especially when you inherit them from other developers.)</p>"

Some tools expect the Google XYZ notation (with tile [0,0] in the upper left corner).
The tiles are otherwise equal, they have just flipped Y coordinate in the file name.</p>

<p>Have a look at this:</p>

<p>Your second question is was about MBTiles. The mbutil utility has a parameter ""--scheme tms"" which allows to create the MBTiles file from tiles rendered with gdal2tiles.py.</p>

You can just drag&amp;drop into the GUI or pass on the command line the KAP file as it is and choose whether you want tiles in directory or MBTiles and it will directly render the output. The tiles are directly optimised as well, there is support for rendering multiple input files into a single layer and rendering is of magnitude faster then with GDAL2Tiles. </p>"

<p>the limit here is not the number of stars, the limit is density, i.e. the number of stars visible at the same time ... with text disabled, i can get up to 700 @ 30fps, on a Core2Duo, with quite a recent version of the debug player ...</p>

<p>i realized, flash player is not very good at clipping ... and that actually, using the most simple way, you spend a whole lot of time moving around objects, that are far from being visible ...</p>

<p>to really be able to optimize things, i chose to use MVC here ... not in the classic bloated way ... the idea is to handle the model, and if any elements are visible, create views for them ...</p>

<p>now the best aproach is to build up a <strong>spatial tree</strong> ... </p>

<ol>
<li>you have leaves, containing objects, and nodes containing leaves or nodes</li>
<li>if you add an object to a leaf and it surpases a certain size, you turn it into a node with n<code>x</code>n leaves, redestributing its children between </li>
<li>any object added to the background will be added to a grid, determined by the object's coordinates ... grids are created just-in-time, an start off as leaves</li>
</ol>

<p>the big advantage of this is, that you can quickly isolate the visible nodes/leaves.
in each iteration, only the nodes/leaves which either turn visible, or are already visible (and may become invisible), are interesting. you need not do any updates in the rest of the tree. after finding all the visible objects, you create views for objects that turn visible, update the position of those that simply stay visible, and destroy views for objects that become invisible ...</p>

<p>this saves an awful lot of everything ... memory and computation power ...
if you try with a huge world size (100000), you will see, that you run out of RAM quickly, long before CPU does anything ... instantiating 500000 stars uses 700MB ram, with about 50 stars visible, running at 70 fps without any tremendous CPU usage ...</p>

<p>the engine is just a proof of concept ... and code looks awful ... the only feature i am currently proud about is, that it supports object to occupate a certain area, which is why an object can be part of several leafs ... i think, this is something i will remove though, because it should give me a great speed up ... you also see, it stalls a little, while adding stars, which happens, when leafs flip to nodes ...</p>

<p>i am quite sure, this is not the best way for a spatial subdivision tree, it's just that everything i found seemed kind of useless to me ... probably someone who studied (and understood) CS, can refine my approach ... :)</p>

<p>other than that, i used an object pool for the views, and <a href=""http://haxe.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Haxe</a>, since it performs better ... a thing that probably is not so clever, is to move all the views individually, instead of putting them on one layer and moving that around ...</p>

<p>some people also render things into <code>BitmapData</code>s manually, to gain performance, which seems to work quite well (just can't find the question right now) ... you should however consider using <code>copyPixels</code> instead of <code>draw</code> ...</p>

<p>hope this helps ... ;)</p>

<pre><code>select *

<pre><code>CREATE TYPE dbo.StringList TABLE (Value NVARCHAR(MAX));
</code></pre>

<p>I tend to just create generic types that can be easily reused, but this would be your call.</p>

<p>Then in your method you would need to split your values into an array and add them to a datatable:</p>

<pre><code>var colourTable = new DataTable();
colourTable.Columns.Add(""Value"", typeof(string));
var colours = Request.QueryString[""vaL1""].Split(',');
for (int i = 0; i &lt; colours.Length; i++)
{
    var newRow = colourTable.NewRow();
    newRow[0] = colours[i];
    colourTable.Rows.Add(newRow);
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can then add this table to your command as a parameter:</p>

<pre><code>string sql = ""SELECT * FROM lady_clock WHERE Color IN (SELECT Value FROM @Colours)""
cmd = new SqlCommand(sql, con);
var parameter = new SqlParameter(""@Colours"", SqlDbType.Structured);
parameter.Value = colourTable;
parameter.TypeName = ""dbo.StringList"";
cmd.Parameters.Add(parameter);

{

    var colourTable = new DataTable();
    colourTable.Columns.Add(""Value"", typeof(string));
    var colours = Request.QueryString[""vaL1""].Split(',');

<ol>
<li>The main window is built.</li>
<li>The user clicks either the <code>pe</code> button or the <code>ep</code> button.</li>
<li>The <code>convert</code> function, which each button is hooked up to, is invoked.</li>
<li>The function runs through to this line: <code>money = float( money.get() )</code>.</li>
<li>Since the user hasn't entered anything yet, <code>money.get()</code> returns an empty string.  Empty strings cannot be made into floats, so a <code>ValueError</code> is thrown.</li>

<p>So, summed up, the problem is that you are not adding any safeties for if <code>money.get</code> returns a string that cannot be converted into a float (i.e. an empty string, a string with letters in it, etc.).</p>

80,1.0,2010-12-07 21:18:44.187000+00:00,"<p>I suspect that the PDFs in question are ""web enabled"", AKA ""linearized""... possibly including the ones with the ""page 2 bug"".</p>

<p>Basically, a linearized PDF has a bunch of ""hints"" at the beginning of the file giving byte offsets to various relevant bits, particularly the byte range needed to display the first page (which is required to be at the front of the PDF).</p>

<p>Requests to read these byte ranges may be broken up into any number of HTTP requests (including ""one"").  It's not particularly odd that iframe &amp; object tags behave differently.

82,2.0,2013-03-28 14:10:35.603000+00:00,"<p>Since you are making several calls to a database file (that isn't going to change), I'd start out by defining your connection string and your SQL statements at the top of your class as global values:</p>

<pre><code>private const int ITEMID_INDEX = 0;
private const int PACKSIZE_INDEX = 1;
private const string SQL_CONN_STR = ""Data Source=\\badPlace2B\\CCRDB.SDF"";
private const string SQL_GET_VENDOR_ITEMS = ""SELECT ItemID, PackSize "" + 
  ""FROM VendorItems "" +
  ""WHERE VendorID=@VendorID AND VendorItemID=@VendorItemID"";
</code></pre>

<p>These never change, so there is no reason to define them again each time you call your routine.</p>

<p>Personally, I do not like inserting values into SQL statements, like you have shown. Rather, try to use Parameters.</p>

<p>To use Parameters, you'll need to look into your database to see what type of columns <code>VendorID</code> and <code>VendorItemID</code> are. My guess is that they are both <strong>int</strong> values, but these could be <strong>GUID</strong> like values, requiring <code>VarChar</code> type strings. If these are strings, you should write down what sizes the columns are defined as.</p>

<p><strong>For example:</strong> Below, my <code>Serial_Number</code> column is the <code>SqlDbType.NVarChar</code> and the size is 50. An <code>SqlCeParameter</code> for this column would be:</p>

<pre><code>cmd.Parameters.Add(""@Serial_Number"", SqlDbType.NVarChar, 50).Value = txtSerial_Number.Text.Trim();
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6diFd.png"" alt=""db table definition""></p>

<p>Since I did not know what type of data you use, I created an enumerated type to show how each method would be used. If you do not have access to the table's design, the last resort is ""AddWithValue"" (I personally hate that one, because it makes me look like I don't know what my database has inside).</p>

<pre><code>enum ParamStyle { AddWithValue, AddIntegers, AddVarChar }
</code></pre>

<p>To use this enumerated type, I modified the signature of your method to pass in that value:</p>

<pre><code>private bool PopulateControlsIfVendorItemsFound(ParamStyle style) {
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, you will not need this, because you should know what technique you are going to be coding with.</p>

<p>I wasn't able to figure out what your <code>dbconn</code> object was. Initially, I thought this was your <code>SqlCeConnection</code>, but that does not have an <code>isValidTable</code> method, so I just commented it out:</p>

<pre><code>  //if (dbconn.isValidTable(""VendorItems"") == -1) {
  //  DUCKBILL.LogMsgs.Append(""VendorItems not a valid table"");//do not see this msg; good! VendorItems is seen as valid...
  //  return false;
  //}
</code></pre>

<p>Speaking of <code>SqlCeConnection</code>...</p>

<p>I combined your <code>SqlCeCommand</code> instance with your <code>SqlCeConnection</code> instance. Less code typically means fewer errors:</p>

<pre><code>  using (var cmd = new SqlCeCommand(SQL_GET_VENDOR_ITEMS, new SqlCeConnection(SQL_CONN_STR))) {
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>CommandType</code>, by default, is <code>CommandType.Text</code>, so this line is unnecessary:</p>

<pre><code>    // cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text; (this is the default)
</code></pre>

<p>I moved most of your variable reading outside of the <code>try/catch</code> routine, as none of that should ever cause an exception to be generated.</p>

<p>Also, I used the more targeted <code>SqlCeException</code> instead of the general <code>Exception</code>. The only thing that could fail in the block is something <code>SqlCe</code> related, and the <code>SqlCeException</code> will give you better/more specific error messages than the general <code>Exception</code> object will.</p>

<pre><code>    } catch (SqlCeException err) {
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason floating point will surprise you is that float and double
  values are normally represented using a finite precision binary
  format. In other words, floating point numbers are not real numbers.
  For example, in your machine's floating point format it might be
  impossible to exactly represent the number 0.1. By way of analogy,
  it's impossible to exactly represent the number one third in decimal
  format (unless you use an infinite number of digits)....
  The message is that some floating point numbers cannot always be
  represented exactly, so comparisons don't always do what you'd like
  them to do. In other words, if the computer actually multiplies 10.0
  by 1.0/10.0, it might not exactly get 1.0 back.</p>

Here's the wrong way to do it:</p>

<pre><code> void dubious(double x, double y)
 {
   ...
   if (x == y)  // Dubious!
     foo();
   ...
 }
</code></pre>

<p>If what you really want is to make sure they're ""very close"" to each other (e.g., if variable a contains the value 1.0 / 10.0 and you want to see if (10*a == 1)), you'll probably want to do something fancier than the above:</p>

<pre><code> void smarter(double x, double y)
 {
   ...
   if (isEqual(x, y))  // Smarter!
     foo();
   ...
 }
</code></pre>

<p>There are many ways to define the isEqual() function, including:</p>

<pre><code> #include &lt;cmath&gt;  /* for std::abs(double) */

 inline bool isEqual(double x, double y)
 {
   const double epsilon = /* some small number such as 1e-5 */;
   return std::abs(x - y) &lt;= epsilon * std::abs(x);
   // see Knuth section 4.2.2 pages 217-218
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Note: the above solution is not completely symmetric, meaning it is possible for isEqual(x,y) != isEqual(y,x). From a practical standpoint, does not usually occur when the magnitudes of x and y are significantly larger than epsilon, but your mileage may vary.</p>"

96,8.0,2011-11-03 10:32:56.673000+00:00,"<p>Short answer: <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p>Long answer:</p>

<p>There is limited introspection available at compilation time, and you can for example (using function overload resolution) detects if a class B is an accessible base class of another class D.</p>

<p>However that's about it.</p>

<p>The Standard does not require full introspection, and notably:</p>

<ul>
<li>you cannot list the (direct) base classes of a class</li>
<li>you cannot know whether a class has only one or several base classes</li>
<li>you cannot even know if a base class is the first base or not</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, there is the issue that the object layout is more or less unspecified, anyway (though C++11 adds the ability to distinguish between trivial layout and class with virtual methods if I remember correctly, which helps a bit here!)</p>

<p>Using Clang, and its AST inspection capabilities, I think you could write a dedicated checker, but this seems quite complicated, and is of course totally non-portable.</p>

<p>Therefore, despite your bold claim <em>P.S. Please don't reply with ""why do you want to do this"" or ""this is against the standard"". I know what what all this for, and I have my reasons to do this.</em>, you will have to adapt your ways.</p>

<p>Of course, if we were given a broader picture of your usage of this class, we might be able to pool our brains together and help you figure a better solution.</p>

<hr>

<p>How to implement a similar system ?</p>

<p>I would propose, first, a simple solution:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</code> is the owner class, non-copyable, non-convertible</li>
<li><code>WrapperRef&lt;U&gt;</code> implements a proxy over an existing <code>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</code> (as long as <code>T*</code> is convertible to <code>U*</code>) and provide the conversions facilities.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will use the fact that all pointers to be manipulated inherit from <code>UnkDisposable</code> (this is a crucial information!)</p>

<p>Code:</p>

<pre><code>namespace details {
  struct WrapperDeleter {
    void operator()(UnkDisposable* u) { if (u) { u-&gt;Release(); } }
  };


  typedef std::unique_ptr&lt;UnkDisposable, WrapperDeleter&gt; WrapperImpl;
}

template &lt;typename T&gt;
class Wrapper {
public:
  Wrapper(): _data() {}

  Wrapper(T* t): _data(t) {}

  Wrapper(Wrapper&amp;&amp; right): _data() {
    using std::swap;
    swap(_data, right._data);
  }

  Wrapper&amp; operator=(Wrapper&amp;&amp; right) {
    using std::swap;
    swap(_data, right._data);
    return *this;
  }

  T* Get() const { return static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(_data.get()); }

  void Attach(T* t) { _data.reset(t); }
  void Detach() { _data.release(); }

private:
  WrapperImpl _data;
}; // class Wrapper&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we laid down the foundations, we can make our adaptive proxy. Because we will only manipulate everything through <code>WrapperImpl</code>, we ensure the type-safety (and the meaningful-ness of our <code>static_cast&lt;T*&gt;</code>) by checking conversions through <code>std::enable_if</code> and <code>std::is_base_of</code> in the template constructors:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;typename T&gt;
class WrapperRef {
public:
  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  WrapperRef(Wrapper&lt;U&gt;&amp; w,
    std::enable_if_c&lt; std::is_base_of&lt;T, U&gt; &gt;::value* = 0):
    _ref(w._data) {}

  // Regular
  WrapperRef(WrapperRef&amp;&amp; right): _ref(right._ref) {}
  WrapperRef(WrapperRef const&amp; right): _ref(right._ref) {}

  WrapperRef&amp; operator=(WrapperRef right) {
    using std::swap;
    swap(_ref, right._ref);
    return *this;
  }

  // template
  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  WrapperRef(WrapperRef&lt;U&gt;&amp;&amp; right,
    std::enable_if_c&lt; std::is_base_of&lt;T, U&gt; &gt;::value* = 0):
    _ref(right._ref) {}

  template &lt;typename U&gt;
  WrapperRef(WrapperRef&lt;U&gt; const&amp; right,
    std::enable_if_c&lt; std::is_base_of&lt;T, U&gt; &gt;::value* = 0):
    _ref(right._ref) {}

  T* Get() const { return static_cast&lt;T*&gt;(_ref.get()); }

  void Detach() { _ref.release(); }

private:
  WrapperImpl&amp; _ref;
}; // class WrapperRef&lt;T&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>It might be tweaked according to your needs, for example you could remove the ability to Copy and Move the <code>WrapperRef</code> class to avoid situation where it point to a no longer valid <code>Wrapper</code>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you could also enrich this using a <code>shared_ptr</code>/<code>weak_ptr</code> approach in order to be able to copy and move the wrapper and still guarantee the availability (but beware of memory leaks).</p>

<p><em>Note: it is intentional that <code>WrapperRef</code> does not provide an <code>Attach</code> method, such a method cannot be used with a base class. Otherwise with both <code>Apple</code> and <code>Banana</code> deriving from <code>Fruit</code>, you could attach a <code>Banana</code> through a <code>WrapperRef&lt;Fruit&gt;</code> even though the original <code>Wrapper&lt;T&gt;</code> was a <code>Wrapper&lt;Apple&gt;</code>...</em></p>

<p><em>Note: this is easy because of the common <code>UnkDisposable</code> base class! This is what gives us a common denominator (<code>WrapperImpl</code>).</em></p>"

100,0.0,2012-01-13 05:57:25.423000+00:00,"<p>First of all, <em>Git is not lying to you</em>. The file really is tracked in the branch, and really does exist in the work tree, and really is untracked.</p>

<p>Given that you suggest in comments elsewhere that the file doesn't show up in diffs or even <code>git status</code>, it sounds like you've added it to your gitignore (maybe unintentionally via a wildcard pattern). I know you said you didn't, but if it doesn't show up in the output of <code>git status</code> as an untracked file, then it's untracked and ignored. To verify this, you can list all files ignored by .gitignore:</p>

<pre><code>git ls-files -i --exclude-from=.gitignore
</code></pre>

<p>You can also list all untracked files, ignored or not:</p>

<pre><code>git clean -xdn
</code></pre>

<p>(You seem to say that you're very sure the file is tracked - if it really were, <code>git show HEAD:path/to/file</code> would show the committed contents of the file. I suspect, however, that that will instead tell ""fatal: Path 'path/to/file' does not exist in 'HEAD'"".)</p>

<p>Another way to verify that the file is untracked and ignored is simply to rename it, then see if <code>git status</code> reports it as deleted; if it doesn't, it wasn't tracked.</p>

<p>Assuming this does list the file in question, you should examine the file in your work tree. You can see what version of the file the other branch has using <code>git show other-branch:path/to/file</code>, to compare. If you're satisfied that you don't need the version in your work tree, simply remove it. If you're worried you might need it, rename it or move it out of the directory. If you realize you do need it, you should figure out what ignore pattern is ignoring it, remove that, add it, and commit it. In any case, once you've dealt with the file, you'll be able to switch branches.</p>"

<li><p>Catch the exception at a higher level anyway, e.g. in the calling method. Often this is a better approach, as you may well want to handle one type of exception from multiple ""small"" operations in the same way from the perspective of the ""larger"" operation.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Personally I generally favour the second approach or the fourth. It's a consistent change: when I want to catch an exception, I introduce a <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> block. The fact that it <em>happens</em> to be inside a <code>using</code> statement is neither here nor there. It ends up with more nesting, but I find it happens rarely enough that that's not a problem.</p>"

<p>Such a scheme would allow you to give encrypted data to a 3rd party, which could then do computations on it for you without knowing what they were computing.</p>

<p>In your case, you need two operations: addition and division. Until recently, homomorphic encryption schemes typically supported only 1 operation. But in september 2009 <a href=""http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2009/tc20090930_463595.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">IMB announced the first fully homomorphic cryptosystem</a>.
